    new card('', '---', 'Zero is Not Used', 'A reading for you still awaits if you follow the guidance below...', 'Guidance: Choose a number between 1 and 333'),
    new card('01', 'CREATION', 'You Are Ready to Create New Energy and Form.', 'Follow your imagination and then take action to bring it into form. It is time to trust your new ideas and projects. The right partner can help you build something new and meaningful. The right partner will want to support you in pursuing your dream. Keep your focus on what you desire and give less energy to the obstacles. Use your single-point focus to bring new energy and ideas to fruition.', 'Guidance: This is my time to trust my vision and follow its call.'),
    new card('02', 'DAYDREAMER', 'Trust that Real Life is Better than Fantasy.', 'Do not get too attached to fantasies that live only in the mind. You can spin your wheels in hope. If you don’t take action that leads you in new directions, you will stay stuck. Sometimes we have to let go of something we have hoped for in order to receive something greater, more real. To bring your dreams to life, you must release the attachment to long-held fantasies. Real life wants to deliver something even better than you could imagine. What will come will be better than your wildest dreams.', 'Guidance: I allow myself to experience something real and wonderful.'),
    new card('03', 'RECEPTIVITY', 'Open Your Heart and Trust -- and You Will Receive.', 'Remember that in order to receive love, we have to trust again.  To open our hearts, even if, (especially if) we have been hurt before. The only way to move forward is to love again. Being willing to receive is half the battle, so find the parts of you that are afraid to be touched and seen in a deeper way. Those old fears are blocking your readiness to move forward, but they are the past. The future is new and good and waiting for you to receive the gifts of love.', 'Guidance: I choose to be open.  I choose to receive new love.'),
    new card('04', 'THE SPONGE', 'It is Time to Define Your Boundaries.', 'You have created an imbalance in your life by allowing someone else’s needs, feelings, or fears to become more important than your own knowingness. If you always put their needs ahead of your own, you take in too much of their energy and concerns. You become water-logged, like a sponge that has gathered up too much of another persons emotions and energy. This weakens you and leaves you with less energy to follow your own guidance. It is time to "dry out" as this kind of fusion is not healthy for you.', 'Guidance: I define myself. I am aware of my own needs and can separate myself from the agendas of others.'),
    new card('05', 'SURRENDER', 'Surrender to Love, Not to a Lover.', 'When you choose to surrender to the process of love, and the act of loving, you create ease and grace. On the other hand, what you resist -- persists. It is not about surrendering to another person’s will, it is about surrendering to the act of loving. To choose to surrender in this way is a great strength. Regain the trust and joy of loving as a child does, fully and simply. Let go of the need to struggle for what you think is right.', 'Guidance: I feel where the flow is, and I lean into it.'),
    new card('06', 'MERCURIAL WINDS', 'Take Care -- Don’t Be Taken for a Ride.', 'There is a strong wind calling you. It is compelling and attractive, but it has a mind of its own. Like a flag in the breeze it is changeable and switches directions easily and without warning. It is easy to be seduced by its easy power and grace. It seems too good to be true in some ways.  But it can turn dark easily, and you want to be careful not to be taken for a ride. This is not the time to take candy from strangers. Make sure to slow down to your own pace and not let another’s sense of certainty replace your own.', 'Guidance: I clarify my purpose. I invest my energy in the truth of my own intentions.'),
    new card('07', 'INNOCENCE', 'Being Open and Honest is the Safest Path.', 'It may be scary to speak your truth, especially when you can’t control the outcome. It may be tempting to play it safe and not state your own true desires. But this causes you to feel stifled. Risk getting a bruise by taking a chance and speaking up. You gain so much more by doing this, such as your own self-respect. Your chances of getting what you really want will increase. Speaking the truth will free you from guilt. Stop hiding from the truth in your own heart.', 'Guidance: When I Speak and Act from the Heart I Become Stronger.'),
    new card('08', 'SLEEPWALKER', 'Open Your Eyes to What is in Front of You.', 'If you want the answer and the solution to what you are struggling with, you need to look at what you have been turning away from. What truth are you ignoring? What are you pretending isn’t so? What do you get from not seeing the truth? If you justify and make excuses, you will pay a very high price for this denial. You don’t have to change everything – or even anything – immediately. The first step to being ready is to see what is really true. Act from your truth, and you will make the best choices.', 'Guidance: It is never too late to wake up and face the truth.'),
    new card('09', 'ACTION', 'Take the Action You Know You Need to Take.', 'If you pay attention, you will realize that deep inside, your heart knows what you need to do. It is time to take action. You have been in “pause” mode for long enough. Don’t let life pass you by while you are waiting to know what to do. You will be supported if you take the right actions, those actions which feel right to your heart. Take the steps that you need to take. It will not always be comfortable, but you will facilitate growth by moving forward.', 'Guidance: I take my destiny into my own hands.'),
    new card('10', 'RECKLESS', 'If You Move too Fast, You Won’t See Clearly.', 'It may feel exciting to charge ahead, and the desire to do so has a lot of power. But if you are in a rush, you may act impetuously. You may regret rash actions later. Hyper-focus keeps you from seeing the full consequences of moving at this pace.  Question the desire for sudden moves. Ask yourself:  “What am I really afraid of?” Do you want to act from that fear?  What feels like a magnetic pull, compelling you to act now, may turn into an anchor that pulls you down deeper than you meant to go.', 'Guidance: I will remain still until I have considered the consequences of action.'),
    new card ('11',	'GOOD WILL', 'Supporting the Greater Good is the Right Choice.', 'Don’t be tempted to put your own agenda on hold in order to help another catch-up. You can’t always move at the same speed. Your first job is to respect your own truth. Then you can look for ways to respect another person’s rhythm and timing. Understanding that you may be moving at different tempos builds love and respect. It is true kindness when you can consider another person’s timing. This grace will allow your own heart to evolve as well. Choose harmony rather than just being right.', 'Guidance: Each time I act in a loving way, I create more love.'),
    new card ('12',	'BLIND LOVE', 'Love Wisely, not Blindly.', 'It is tempting to only see what you want to see. Ignoring the "ugly truth" won’t make it beautiful and won’t make it go away.  We all have our good and bad sides, and the trick is to see it all. We don’t have to judge, but neither do we want to be fooled by our own blindness or another person’s promises if their actions aren’t matching their words. If you choose not to see what is really happening in front of you, you run the risk of becoming a fool for love.', 'Guidance: When I face the music I will find the joy of dancing to the truth.'),
    new card('13', 'HARMONY', 'Emotional Symmetry Creates Stable Relationships.', 'Harmony occurs when both partners are committed to making sure that each of you get your basic needs met. When two parts come together in unity, it creates synergy. The strength is greater than either could achieve separately. By honoring each other’s truth, it builds a desire to serve the relationship as a whole. This foundation of trust means that each feels safe to express their truth. Agreement is possible between two people who know their true feelings and act in alignment with them. Long-term stability and consistency come from the equal exchange of energy.', 'Guidance: I seek synergy. It leads me to greater wholeness.'),
    new card('14', 'JAGGED EDGE', 'If you Feel Broken, Don’t Expect Your Partner to Make You Feel Whole.', 'Past wounds create sharp edges. Sharp edges generate sharp words. Letting sharp, jagged, edgy words fly out of your mouth leads to tension and irritability, which will quickly drown out the feelings of love. Like a damaged record, the pattern keeps repeating, and no forward motion is really achieved. It is an inside job if your wounds are playing a sad song. We have to change our own tune and not expect someone else to heal our wounds or make us feel whole.', 'Guidance: I will soften my tune to hear the song of our love.'),
    new card('15', 'GREAT WHITE BEAR', 'Love is Gentle but it is also Firm When it Needs to Be.','To nurture love you must pay attention. By being attentive, responsive, and warm, love grows. But remember your own needs as much as your partner’s. If you are always putting someone else’s needs ahead of your own, you weaken both of you. Put your oxygen mask on first, because if you are out of air, you can’t help anyone else. Strong love means speaking up for your truth and seeking a method where the needs of both of you can be met.', 'Guidance: Like Mother Earth watering her plants with rain, so I nurture my love with self-kindness.'),
    new card('16', 'ENGULFMENT", "To Smother Love is not to Let its Flames Live.', 'Fear of abandonment causes clinging. To attempt to entrap a lover is never to have their authentic love. If you don’t feel safe inside, no one can make you feel safe. You must find your personal path to a sense of safety and not expect someone to save you from the feeling of fear. Your partner will become fatigued with the endless need to “make you” feel safe. You have to begin to find this sense of security from within yourself. Let go of wanting to control the other person in order to come together in wholeness.', 'Guidance: Because I love you, I love your desire for freedom and growth.'),
    new card('17', 'TRANSFORMATION', 'To be Willing to Change is to Live Fully.', 'Life is change. When we don’t resist that truth, we become more fully engaged with life. You and your partner need to fall in love with the process of life. Nothing can stay the same.  Still waters create stagnation. Trust that the flow and motion are leading you in the right direction. But don’t be in a rush to change. And don’t expect the other person to change at your speed. Trust the process and timing of change, including the stage of hibernation and inaction. Cocoons may not look beautiful but the transformation into butterflies always is.', 'Guidance: As I accept the entire process of growth, it becomes more graceful.'),
    new card('18', 'THE ILLUSIONIST', 'Do not be Fooled by Your Own Desire to Believe.', 'We all want to believe that we can find a pot of gold. Some people have a lot of glitter -- but not a heart of gold. Look beneath the surface appearances. Dare to step behind the wizard’s curtain. It may be painful at first to see the truth, but you will come that much closer to home. If someone has promised you a pot of gold, take a close look to see if it is real. The only way to know for sure is to really see with open eyes. Be brave, recognize the truth in front of you.', 'Guidance: When I face the truth, and stop hiding, I will be free.'),
    new card('19', 'SELF-GUIDANCE', 'In Silence, All Answers Can Be Heard.', 'When your emotional waters are running high, and a wild story is running in your mind, it can be difficult to hear the truth from the quiet knowing place within. Calm down the mental chatter. Sometimes you have to close your mouth to hear what your heart is saying. Logic doesn’t always provide clarity because logic is where the mind hides from the heart. If you listen to somebody else’s version of the truth, make sure you are listening from a calm enough place so you can also hear your own heart.', 'Guidance: When I trust myself, I know the answer.'), 
    new card('20', 'SUPERSTITION', 'Don’t Invest in Someone Else’s Fears.', 'Just because you feel fear doesn’t mean it is real. Sometimes we have a habit of fearing, based upon hand-me-down ideas that no longer fit our current goals and dreams. Who would you be without these fears? What would you do without them? How would you live your life? Examine these old feelings. Are they truly based in reality? Or have you had them for so long they just feel real? Anxiety crowds the room of love. It keeps you from being in and enjoying the present.', 'Guidance: My fears come from the past. Joy clarifies the path forward.'),
    new card('21', 'SERENITY', 'Serenity is Power.', 'Serenity helps you to see clearly. If you need to make a decision, first find some peace. Claim your own timing for finding clarity, not someone else’s need for a quick answer.  Slow down and find the inner peace which can only be perceived when we are moving slow enough. Rushing doesn’t mature love.  Stillness, quietness, calmness are strengths you need to call upon to hear your truth. When you calm yourself, no one can push your buttons.', 'Guidance: As I find my serenity, I find my solution.'),
    new card('22', 'THE ICE QUEEN/KING', 'Fear Freezes. Love Thaws.', 'Fear causes us to pull back and contract. Withdrawing from intimacy makes us untouchable, or so we think. The truth is that fear keeps us trapped and frozen in time. If your partner is feeling fear, they may withdraw. On the outside, you may see their beauty, but on the inside, their emotions are frozen into inaccessibility. Be careful of frostbite because a numb person can hurt you without even realizing they are causing you pain. Emotional unavailability locks people into the past and makes them unable to enjoy pleasure and love in the present.', 'Guidance: It is time for my heart to thaw and beat again.'),
    new card('23', 'THE CLEARING', 'The Light at the End of the Tunnel is just a Little Further Ahead.', 'You have been on a long journey, but the suffering is almost over. Are you ready to release the pain? Even if it is a familiar travel companion, it is time to let yourself move toward what you truly want and need. Turn your attention away from the past and focus on the light ahead. You have a habit of looking at what has been, because, since it was known, it has become comfortable. Now you need to re-train your eyes to orient toward a new light. You are almost free. It’s time to celebrate the brave unknown.', 'Guidance: I move toward the light. I move toward love.'),
    new card('24', 'THE BRICK WALL', 'Let Go of Resistance to Love.', 'When the heart is barricaded, new love cannot come in. The first step is to release old pain and choose to love again. The obstructions you are seeing outside are really an expression of your own reluctance to trust. It is not the other person you need to trust, but the process of love. You believe you have no support. But it is not your partner who can support you in the way your wounded heart hopes they will. With your heart protected behind your shield, you can’t really feel the love you deserve.  Love with the innocence of one who has never been hurt.', 'Guidance: I trust love. It is the vital force and energy that sustains me.'),
    new card('25', 'RAPPORT', 'Build a Bridge Between Your Two Worlds.', 'You can look at your partner and see difference or sameness.  Both are true, as you have come on different paths in this life.  The question is whether you focus on what is different, or what is innately the same. Whatever you focus on becomes magnified between you. It is magical when you drop your judgment of how the other person is different and instead appreciate the common areas between you. You have the ability to create this compatibility.', 'Guidance: Compatibility is not an accident. I can create compatibility.'),
    new card('26', 'CHAMELEON', 'To Thine Own Self, Be True.', 'You are very good at pleasing others or bending to fit their mold. That is a good tool, but not the one you should use all the time. If you are always marching to someone else’s drum it is easy to lose touch with yourself and your needs. It is nice to please another, but not at the expense of what feels right to you. Don’t lose touch with your own needs, styles, and goals. To love another, not only must you first love yourself, but you must have a "self" to love.', 'Guidance: I honor my own truth.'),
    new card('27', 'HUMILITY', 'Gently Face Your Flaws, and Forgive Them.', 'You have very high standards. That is good, except when it turns into being overly self-critical. The fact is, we are imperfect as a species. We are all evolving in this game of life together. You will be free when you can gently see your flaws. It is fine to strive to become better, but it must come from a fundamental acceptance that we are perfectly imperfect. To be both aware and tolerant of one’s own flaws is a gift. Forgive imperfections in yourself and you will be more tolerant of the flaws of others.', 'Guidance: I am patient because I remember that God is not finished with me yet.'),
    new card('28', 'SELF-RESPECT', 'Begin to Believe in Yourself.', 'For a long time, you have accepted other people’s versions of who you are, and have allowed your value to be “given or taken” by their approval. Begin to take actions – as if you did believe in yourself to cultivate faith in yourself. In other words, you have to “act as if” you believe in yourself by taking the kind of actions that a strong person would take. It is not serving you any longer to be meek or unassertive. Power is a muscle, and the more you use it, the stronger you will become. If you believe you deserve better treatment, you’ll get it.', 'Guidance: When I stand up for myself I become stronger.'),
    new card('29', 'SELECTION', 'You Are the Choices You Make.', 'There is more than one choice available. Choose carefully because there is always more than one possibility. If you lock down your mind into thinking there is only one option, you will not be open to seeing even better possibilities. Try on each scenario in your mind, and see how it feels in your core, in your heart. Pay attention to the subtle sensations each choice generates. One direction feels happier, juicier, and much fuller. After really listening to your inner knowingness you will know what is right for you.', 'Guidance: When I choose wisely, my life will move forward in wonderful ways.'),
    new card('30', 'HEART JUGGLING', 'Don’t Try to Juggle too Many Things at Once.', 'There is only room for so many eggs in your basket. If you put too many in, they all begin to break. Being afraid to choose hurts everyone involved. You have to let go of some things to gain freedom, happiness, and sanity. You want to recognize that when you are juggling too many options, your energy splits in too many directions. This split-focus causes you to lose your power. Your energy drains when you are trying to march to many drums. It takes courage to choose.','Guidance: I am brave enough to let go of what doesn’t truly serve me.'),
    new card('31',	'RELEASE', 'Let Go of Trying to Control.', 'You think that you have to control everything in order to feel safe. But this struggle just prevents the possibility of love to flow in the way it wants to. It is like trying to redirect a river. It won’t work, and it will exhaust you. You want to allow change to happen, rather than force it or prevent it. It is a habit to struggle because it is what you know. But it is not your best strategy. There is a great peace that comes from letting go. Freedom is in the release, and this gives you the power to move forward.', 'Guidance: The joy will flow when I let go.'),
    new card('32', 'POWER OF WORDS', 'Words Can Harm or Heal. The Choice is Yours.', 'To keep communication lines flowing you need to choose your words wisely. Some indigenous cultures believe that words echo throughout all eternity, so choose words that you wish to become a thread in your eternal sound tapestry. Harsh words can rip at the fabric of relationships, making them hard to repair. If someone has spoken harsh words to you, forgive them their ignorance of this law of eternality. Love needs support, not criticism or verbal attack. Use the active discipline of finding the best words to express your truth while being kind to the listener.', 'Guidance: Words of kindness echo through all eternity.'),
    new card('33', 'LOVE', 'Love Is a Choice – it’s a Decision to Act in a Loving Way.', 'Some people think that love is something they fall into, like a happy accident. But sustainable love is more mature. It is a daily devotion. Love is an action, an ongoing choice to care. It is something that is either done or not done. It is a verb. Not a noun, a "thing" that happens to the lucky ones. Closeness, intimacy, passion are not accidents. We create them by investing our feelings of bonding, warmth, tenderness, caring, excitement, and interest. Deep devotion comes through repeated acts of loving.', 'Guidance: Lovingly is the answer to all questions of how to act.'),
    new card('34', 'ATTACHMENT', 'Being Attached and Being in Love are Opposites.', 'Sometimes we confuse love and attachment. There is a difference between being attached to the form of a relationship, rather than loving the person for who they actually are. If wanting to hold on to, or control a person is more important than growth and love, the relationship will degenerate. Love thrives with freedom and allowing truth to emerge. Let go of your preconceived ideas of what the relationship “should” look like. Then you will discover what is really true between you.',  'Guidance: Release attachments to discover the truth about love.'),
    new card('35', 'PARAGON', 'Avoid the Tyranny of Comparison.', 'It is one thing to have high standards that inspire you to do your best. It is another to have standards that always make yourself and others fall short. Who do these principles serve? Do they move you closer to your goal, or simply keep the goal always in the distance? To be comparing to a standard of perfection means to always be dissatisfied with what is. Find the beauty, truth, and love in what is, and you will find the satisfaction you have been keeping away through attachments to “fault-finding” missions.', 'Guidance: Judgment and comparisons chip away at love.'),
    new card('36', 'DIFFICULTY', 'Release Your Fixation on Obstacles.', 'Suffering can become addictive, because it is familiar. We sometimes prefer this to the unknown. Pain is inevitable in life, but suffering is optional. When hardship and troubles keep recurring, look for the pattern of difficulty that keeps emerging in each of the seemingly different areas of manifestation. Obstacles that recur indicate issues in the psyche that need to be revealed. Heal the underlying pattern, and the obstacles will dissolve.', 'Guidance: To surrender with love is to surrender to love.'),
    new card('37', 'THE ADVENTURER', 'Everything and Everyone are New – if You Look at Them with Fresh Eyes.', 'In nature, everything is new because everything is renewing. You also have a desire to feel fresh and alive so you take risks and seek thrills. This is a natural desire. But what if what you are seeking is closer to home? Discover the simple joys right in front of your eyes to prevent the mind from becoming stagnant. Perhaps what you are yearning for is right in front of you. Excessive exploring can become wandering. Searching is good unless it becomes an end in itself.', 'Guidance: Wherever you go, you find yourself. Whoever you turn to, you face yourself.'),
    new card('38', 'THE INVADER', 'Temptations of the Night can Turn Ugly in the Light of Day.', 'When the drums of passion pound too loudly, it’s hard to hear the soft beat of the heart. Temptations can sway the mind with the promise of wild, exotic fun. But all that glitters is not durable in the long run. Be aware of conquerors who live for the chase, and exploit tenderness. Cunning and evasiveness lead nowhere you want to go. It may look like wild, fun carnivals of the mind and body, but look past the costumes and glamor. Remember the deeper values that are your true treasures.', 'Guidance: Whose fault is it if you hand over your treasure to pirates?'),
    new card('39', 'WISE WAITING', 'Wait, Watch, and Be Wise.', 'Postpone any decisions you are not sure about. Guard your deeper values and feelings, don’t settle for a compromise that ignores the wisdom deep in your soul. Stay put! Now is the time to wait, watch, and see what emerges. The truth will be revealed through patience and accurate observation – not by seeing what you want to see. If you slow down and wait to take action until there is evidence of what you truly wish, you will steer your boat correctly and stay on course.', 'Guidance: Time out! Watch and wait until you see evidence of what you truly desire.'),
    new card('40', 'TRUST DELAY', 'There is Wisdom in Hesitation.', 'There is a hindrance for a reason, although it may not be visible now. Interest is waning. Don’t go through with an action just because it once seemed like a good plan. Feelings change. Be wise, and sense the difference between what was once true and what is true now. Listen to your heart about this issue. Do you feel a green light, telling you to move forward? Or is it yellow for caution? Or red for stop! You must listen to your deep inner knowingness, not your temporarily activated emotional state. Take the time to get quiet enough to hear your true wisdom.', 'Guidance: Step back -- dissolve the ties – in order to see clearly what lies ahead.'),
    new card('41', 'DECLARATION', 'Stand Up and Speak Your Truth.', 'If you don’t speak your truth, you are standing on a false foundation. Relationships built on withholding truth will crumble under the weight of repression. It is a bold risk to truly express yourself, your feelings, and your point of view. Breathe! Assert your ideas, demonstrate your vision. Let it all hang out. The results may not be what you hoped for, but the resulting clarity will allow you to move forward with your true intentions.', 'Guidance: Be true to yourself in words, thoughts, and deeds.'),
    new card('42', 'CONTENTION', 'Wanting to Be Right Keeps You Locked in the Struggle.', 'Would you rather be right – or be happy? Be honest about why you are stuck in the struggle. Power struggles never result in anything put perpetuation of discord. What you think you are arguing about may not be the root cause. Discover the core need you have -- and the petty arguments and squabbles will dissolve. But holding on to quarrels, animosity, and feuds only increases bitterness, and could even lead to litigation. Fighting often obscures the truth because people have lost sight of what really matters.', 'Guidance: Choose love -- surrender the willful need to be right.'),
    new card('43', 'CHARMER', 'When you Sleep with a Charmer, You Wake Up with a Snake.', 'An enchanter can be delightful and engaging, flirtatious and fascinating. Who wouldn’t be tantalized by the star of the show? It seems so flattering to have their attention. But, remember that attention will wander in time. If you feel compelled to engage, you are not free to choose. If you find the allure irresistible, then you have already been bewitched. Hold onto your hat, it’s going to be a spellbinding ride.', 'Guidance: Where there is a charmer, there is a coiled snake.'),
    new card('44', 'PARASITE', 'You Have Given Much, But What Have You Gotten in Return?', 'When one person does almost all the giving, there is an imbalance in energy. This situation eventually becomes stagnant, or dangerous. Someone who lives at the expense of others, giving little in return, is a hanger-on, a leech, a parasite. Allowing the other person to indulge selfishness is more expensive than you realize. When you give the gift of yourself to someone who doesn’t treasure you, you are hurting yourself.', 'Guidance: Wake up! The truth is right in front of you, open your eyes.'),
    new card('45', 'CHAOS', 'Out of the Fires of Dissolution, a Rebirth Will Occur.', 'There is a season for birth, for growth, for dissolution. What appears as a loss, disorder, and confusion are really the cycle of preparation before new creation, deeper understanding, and more profound love. Instead of resisting or hanging on to the old ways, allow negative patterns to be dissolved. Celebrate the internal spring of regeneration. Clear the decks and prepare for a rebirth and new delights. Trust the process. Something better is emerging.', 'Guidance: From the ashes and disorder, new life, new love, and new order begin.'),
    new card('46', 'DISSONANCE', 'Don’t Build Your House on a Cracked Foundation.', 'If you are not on the same page with your partner, this creates instability. While it may not be obvious -- there is a potential for disunion -- because of an underlying disagreement about styles, vision, purpose, or values. Something is not right and this creates inconstancy, strife, wavering, mutation, dissension, and clashes. You thought you were in agreement, but at a deeper level, your mission has been compromised.', 'Guidance: Listen carefully. The message is loud and clear – if you are paying attention.'),
    new card('47', 'RADIANCE', 'Send Your Love and Light Into the World, and You Will Be Seen.','Don’t hide. Don’t deny your beauty, your sweetness, and your light. Be true to yourself, and the world will unfold to embrace you. Take a risk by being authentic, and present your authentic self to the world. Those who are ready will respond, those who are not will fade away. You will feel happier when you accept your own grace. Give yourself permission to shine and glow, letting your truth be revealed.', 'Guidance: Give out your light and recognize the light in others.'),
    new card('48', 'CELEBRATE DIFFERENCES', 'Do Not Try to Turn Others Into Copies of Yourself.', 'When you accept the differences in each other, you find connection and harmony. When you assume they think or feel the same, or should act the same as you, you do both of you a disservice. Trying to teach a horse to sing is not only pointless but very much annoys the horse. Better to discover what is unique and wonderful about the horse. Trying to pressure someone to change under the guise of "trying to save them" belittles them. People have their own journeys with their own lessons to learn.', 'Guidance: Love is recognizing the truth and beauty of difference and not trying to make the other person the same as you.'),
    new card('49', 'SYNERGY', 'It is an Illusion that You Are All Alone. Allow Yourself to Be in Partnership with the Universe.', 'Surrender the idea that you have to do it all yourself. That is what makes you feel lonely. Recognize that you and God are a team, working together to make your life unfold in perfect timing. Ask to receive the perfect partner. Accept that a process is at work, a process of preparing. You and your partner are preparing for each other. The truth is that there is synergy in the Universe. It is an illusion that you are all alone struggling to make it happen. Give up your self-imposed isolation, and prepare to receive true partnership.', 'Guidance: Remember you are not on this journey alone.'),
    new card('50', 'ECLIPSE', 'Don’t Let the Shadow of Fear Make you Forget Your Light.', 'Certain circumstances can trigger a flood of emotions, such as fear, which clouds your judgment. Staring into the storm, you are tempted to forget your own light, your own truth. To be blinded by temporary darkness and fear would be unwise. Let fearful thoughts pass like clouds. To worship the apparent currently darkened reality -- instead of the underlying truth -- will disconnect you from your love. Resist the temptation to be seduced by the passing exotic lure of danger.',  'Guidance: When it’s darkest, remember the light will soon return.'),
    new card('51', 'SEPARATION', 'Sometimes Separation is the Most Loving Action.', 'There is a time for connection, and there is a time for separation. Recognizing differences in values, needs, and purpose, without judgment, can lead to freedom and growth. If it is time to go your separate ways, do so with kindness, grace, and forgiveness. Begin by withdrawing your energy and emotions, and prepare for a healthy detachment. Practice consideration for the other person without compromising your own timing.', 'Guidance: Release yourself and the other from blame.'),
    new card('52', 'DISRUPTION', 'Even Sweet Little Birds get Kicked Out of the Nest When it is Time to Leave.', 'It is easy to get comfortable and act like a sleepwalker. Nobody likes a rude awakening. The only way to avoid it is to be alert to impending change, and begin to prepare. Upheavals are most disturbing when you are not paying attention to the signs of a coming storm. Pay attention, or pay the price. Even nature has violent disruptions, because when change is overdue it will happen of its own force. The only thing you can depend on is that change is coming.', 'Guidance: Disruption is an invitation to change. Accept it with your eyes open, and the process will be more graceful.'),
    new card('53', 'BALANCE', 'Balance Allows You to See the Truth and Live With Equilibrium.','Strong emotions can create an imbalance in perspective. Before making an important decision, find your emotional equilibrium by seeing the whole picture. Recognize any conflicting needs within yourself. Harmony starts from within a still heart, it doesn’t come from flip-flopping. You need to feel a personal sense of balance before you can engage in a healthy exchange with others. Discipline yourself to seek your own balance before making important choices or communicating important decisions to others.', 'Guidance: Before making any decisions make sure your emotional seas are steady and calm.'),
    new card('54', 'RIGIDITY', 'Inflexibility Leads to Stagnation or Destruction.', 'A bamboo tree is flexible. When the wind blows, it bends and returns. A dry and brittle branch can break in a strong wind. If you are inflexible you rip the subtle fabric of a relationship, because the person reflexively resists your unyielding force.  Being too judgmental, severe, exacting, straight-laced, or trying to impose your will on others is unwise. It simply causes them to resist and want to break free.', 'Guidance: Love is not about getting someone to bend to your will. Love is about allowing each other’s truths to be honored.'),
    new card('55', 'GUIDANCE', 'Your Inner Compass Will Lead You in the Right Direction – If You Are Listening.', 'Letting the opinions of other people override your own is dangerous for your well-being, because it causes you to mistrust your inner direction. Begin to pay more attention to your own gut feelings, your intuition, and your inner knowingness. It takes time to listen, but your real truth will not lead you astray. Then you will begin to sense the subtle influence of the Angels who are guiding you to your true destiny.', 'Guidance: Imagine the impossible as possible, and it may become so.'),
    new card('56', 'NAVEL-GAZING', 'It Isn’t Personal. Even if it Feels that Way.', 'When you see the world purely through the filter of your own desires, you develop tunnel vision. You reduce the field of possibility to what you can see, or what you desire. But this causes a loss of perspective. Then everything that happens feels personal, when in fact the world is unfolding perfectly. You just need a bigger perspective to understand its purpose, which is to cause you to grow in ways you have been resisting.', 'Guidance: Expand your realm of possibilities.  Release your self-imposed limitations.'),
    new card('57', 'HEALTHY BOUNDARIES', 'Self Respect Involves Setting Limits.  Without Limits, You Compromise Your Self-Esteem.', 'You need to decide where to draw the line in your interactions with others. How much is enough, when is it too much? If you don’t know, you can’t communicate this. Do not expect others to always honor the line. That is up to you. Withdraw yourself from situations that repeatedly cause you to go past the limit you have set for yourself. When others see that you are treating yourself with respect, they will do the same, or find someone else to abuse. Respect your time, energy, resources, body, mind, and spirit – and people will then respect your choices.', 'Guidance: Love yourself first -- and others will treat you well.'),
    new card('58', 'CASTLE WALLS', 'Barricading Yourself with Your History Leaves You Trapped in the Past.', 'Putting armor around your heart keeps you stuck. Isolation appears to be the safe solution, but it closes you down and makes it impossible for new love to penetrate your invisible walls. Now is time to open to new love and new possibilities. Even though you have been hurt before, this is time to allow your heart to be touched again. You are wiser than you were before, and you will not accept what you once accepted. Trusting love again is what will help you heal.',

It is time to transform old barriers and beliefs. Allow yourself to shift, diversify, restyle, reconstruct, reshape, remodel, and metamorphose into your true self. As you let go of old ideas about how things should be, you will feel inspired. Think, speak, and act differently, and you will experience different results.', 'Guidance: Act as if you’re already the person you want to be.'),
    new card('60', 'VACILLATION', 'If You Are Always Flitting Around, You May Find You Have Missed the One Thing You Have Been Seeking.', 'If you are trying too many things at once, you can’t enjoy any one of them. Mature love requires a certain constancy, not a continual fluctuation. If you are too capricious or mercurial, you never get to experience the depth of consistency. You may believe that diversification protects your heart, but it does the opposite, because your heart is not fully engaged with anyone.  The time for indecisiveness, fickleness, and blowing hot and cold is over. Make a choice and stick to it.', 'Guidance: Steady yourself, choose your path, and invest your heart fully.'),
    new card('61', 'ADORATION', 'It is Wonderful to Cherish Another Person – but If They Are Not Ready to Receive You, Your Attention is a Burden.', 'Adoring someone completely is a beautiful thing. But if they are not able to receive and return your attention, then it becomes an imbalanced endeavor. This may cause a rude or painful awakening. Crushes are sweet and tender – to you – but if the other person doesn’t want to reciprocate, you have to move on. Real love includes and respects the other person’s timing and wishes. Don’t allow the intensity of your feelings to overwhelm another who doesn’t feel the same toward you.', 'Guidance: To allow love to blossom, you have to give it room.'),
    new card('62', 'WORSHIP', 'To Put Someone on a Pedestal is to Invite Them to an Inevitable Fall.','If you put someone on a pedestal and magnify their virtues, you are glorifying them in a way that they wouldn’t even recognize themselves. It may be fun for a moment to idolize someone, but it wears thin. They feel they can’t live up to your glorified standards, and part of them will want to go in the opposite direction – and show you their worst side. Idolizing someone does not honor their simple (and flawed) humanity. Let go of your infatuation and need to have someone be perfect.', 'Guidance: Love is the opposite of infatuation, because love accepts the reality and frailty of humanness.'),
    new card('63', 'PEELING THE ONION', 'Go Slower, but Move In Deeper by Being Authentic and Vulnerable.', 'Love and life are revealed in layers. Instead of rushing to get somewhere, go slowly. Reveal your authentic truth, your vulnerability. Intimacy takes time, takes courage. Be willing to see and be seen by another. Gently, kindly move closer, without invading the other person’s boundaries or rushing them. Real love is based on willingness to reveal your true self and accept the true core of another. True vulnerability is the best protection against isolation.', 'Guidance: Intimacy means taking emotional risks, being vulnerable, and revealing your true feelings.'),

These things wear you down, deepening a groove of old patterns that keep you feeling bad about yourself. In extreme, it is a form of mental and emotional abuse. Why do you allow it? It may be familiar, but it is not love. Love is not cruel, harsh, or seeking to undermine your personal power. But it is you who needs to stop riding the treadmill. Just get off the rotten ride!', 'Guidance: If it doesn’t feel good – it isn’t good. Walk away and leave old patterns behind.'),
    new card('65', 'RECOGNITION', 'Recognize and Honor Differences.', 'The goal in life is not to try to get someone else to be exactly like you. There are no exact human copies. The goal of healthy love is to recognize differences and support each other in your uniqueness. We don’t always feel, think, or see things exactly the same way. We have individual needs, styles, and priorities, based on our own life design. Recognizing difference is the first step to acceptance and validation of each other. Make accommodations for each other’s perspectives and priorities.', 'Guidance: Recognize your own core values – and then seek to respect differences in others.'),
    new card('66', 'DOUBT', 'If It Doesn’t Feel Right – It Isn’t Right.', 'There is an art to working with doubt, because it is often a Molotov cocktail of emotional complexity. You want to believe what you want to believe, yet your gut tells you something is wrong. You start to distrust the other person, as well as your own reactions. Ask “Is there any truth to what I am feeling?”  There is no guarantee that they will be honest, but at least you are coming clean and owning your own doubts. This allows you to feel less conflicted. Observe the behavior and see if their words and their actions are matching? If not, you have your answer.', 'Guidance: Trust your heart, then you will be able to make better choices.'),
    new card('67', 'RETURN', 'There is No Shame in Trying Again – Especially if You Know YOU Will Act Differently.', 'If you choose to go back and try one more time – make sure that you have changed. Identify at least one behavior you had that made the relationship unhealthy, and make sure you are ready to act differently. You can’t guarantee that anyone other than yourself will change. But if even one person behaves in a healthier manner, it transforms the dynamic between you both. This is an opportunity to get it right – because you can change! But if you boomerang backward too quickly, you’ll end up feeling the same.', 'Guidance: Give yourself another chance – to be a better partner.'),

You can trade partners, but if your patterns are the same, you will recreate the same dynamics. If it feels familiar, it is because what is the same is your own patterns. The faces of your partners may change, but if the patterns haven’t, the relationships will end up feeling the same.', 'Guidance: Heal the past, or you will carry it with you into the future.'),
    new card('69', 'FIDELITY', 'Find Alignment Between Your Thoughts, Words, and Actions, and You Will Find Your Truth.', 'When there is a match between your thoughts, words, and actions, you will live a life of integrity. This is what will make you feel at peace with yourself. Sincerity and truthfulness must be first with yourself, then you can be honest with another. Make peace with yourself – by admitting your own truth. Steadfastness and loyalty are by-products of faithfulness to the self. Commit to be loyal to the truth, and fidelity will follow.', 'Guidance: Fidelity comes from the bravery of living the truth.'),
    new card('70', 'TENACIOUS', 'Love and Freedom Make the Best Partners. Trying to Control Another Never Works for Long.', 'Love and freedom are partners. To be too attached to a particular outcome or behavior does not leave much room for love. Clinging, stubbornness, and being adamant are toxic to love. It is an old habit to try to impose your will on another, but this habit no longer serves you. There is a better way. Trying to control someone else’s choices or behavior does not bring them closer to you. In fact, it does the opposite. People who feel trapped are not feeling love.', 'Guidance: Let go. Trust that what is meant to be will emerge.'),
    new card('71', 'THE MOUNTAIN – Quiet, Steady Strength Brings Perspective and Clear Vision.', 'As you look at your situation, are you viewing it as a river would see it – with its constant flow? Or are you seeing it as a mountain would see it – with its quiet, steady power? Both perspectives have value, but right now you need the wisdom of the mountain. Don’t just look at temporary events – but rather see the longer, bigger picture. You have learned the lessons and earned the solidity to support yourself. To get perspective sometimes you have to stand back from the problem and view it as a mountain would.', 'Guidance: In silence, all answers can be heard.'),
    new card('72', 'THE TREADMILL', 'When You Focus Only on the Immediate Problem You Might Be Missing the Bigger Picture.', 'There is an issue that has all your attention because it is right in front of you and is pushing your buttons. As annoying as this problem is, it can cause you to have tunnel vision. You are missing the full panoramic view. Myopic vision doesn’t allow you to see the whole picture. Recognize the tree, but see the forest also. To make a real change you must understand both the context and the essence of the problem.', 'Guidance: The truth is infinitely grander than your current perception.'),
    new card('73', 'PERSONAL GROWTH', 'If Your Focus is on what is Wrong with the Other Person, Neither of You Will Change.', 'If you want someone or something to change, you must first change yourself. Putting all your focus on what is wrong with the other person is like an emotional traffic jam. You will stay stuck and your resentment of them will grow. Instead, honestly ask yourself what you could do to bring yourself more peace of mind.  Focusing on your own growth process instead of trying to fix the other person will lead to change and freedom. Realize that “The Blame Game” is a trap, and everything that happens (or doesn’t happen) is a reflection of your own consciousness.', 'Guidance: Stop blaming and start living!'),
    new card('74', 'SELF-JUDGMENT', 'Being Your Own Worst Enemy is a Lousy Form of Protection.', 'Some people are overly self-critical, as if this could somehow protect them from the judgment of others. Comparing yourself to someone else is a very self-defeating strategy. Being fully occupied with beating yourself up leaves little room for others to see you in a positive light. This deprives you of love, honor, and respect. The idea that everything is your fault has way outlived its time. Recycle this idea!', 'Guidance: Invest your time, energy, and thoughts in your own goodness.'),
    new card('75', 'FOCUS', 'What You Focus On, You Get More Of.', 'Your focus is the power-steering for your life. If you want more love in your life, you have to be in love. Whether or not you have a partner, you want to put your attention on things you love. Focusing on lack, or loneliness, only brings more of that to you. Focus is a magnet and attracts to itself what you put out through your emotional intention and thoughts. Just as a chariot needs all horses pulling in the same direction, it is the same way with your thoughts. Reminding yourself to focus on what you want, and not on the obstacles, will increase your power.', 'Guidance: What you focus on is what you get.'),

You may think there is only one answer, one solution, one person who can make you happy, but this is not true. Life always has more possibilities. There are more options than you are seeing. There is a bigger picture that you may be missing because of your hopes and preconceptions. Ask to be shown the truth. If you ignore the red flags and see only what you want to see, don’t blame the other person for your self-delusion.', 'Guidance: I am ready, willing, and able to see and know the truth.'),
    new card('77', 'CATALYST', 'Big Changes Are the Birthing of New Possibilities.', 'No one is ever prepared for sudden or abrupt change. With dramatic shifts or changes in living situations, come disruption of the status quo. It is a time to re-question values, priorities, intentions. Growth will come. You must trust this process and steer into the storm. You can resist the process, or surrender into the acceleration of growth and change. A turning point is here or imminent. Someone better is waiting for you.', 'Guidance: Volcanoes erupt, but cool to make new land with new adventures.'),
    new card ('78', 'SHAKY FOUNDATION', 'If There is a Crack in the Core Foundation, You Can’t Build On It.', 'Even if on the surface there appears to be solidity, if there is broken trust or even a difference in core values, the foundation is shaky. Be on the look-out for indications of leaks, cracks, or weak connection points, such as ways that you disagree, or have different goals. Talk about these issues openly and without judgment. Resolve trust issues, as broken trust can eat away at even the strongest relationship.', 'Guidance: With values out of alignment with each other, projects and relationships will face uncertain futures.'),
    new card('79', 'DREAMSEED', 'All Creation Begins with an Idea – Then you Must Take the Right Actions.', 'Know what stage of the process of creation you are in. Perhaps you are in the idea generation stage, which is about being quiet, allowing inspiration to come, or letting the other person’s heart catch up to yours. Dreams need to be nurtured and tended. If you have an idea, desire, or vision for connection, you need to cultivate it. Make sure there is consistent alignment between your thoughts, words, and actions. If another person is involved in this dream, make sure you have the same vision.', 'Guidance: What you actively, lovingly cultivate -- will grow.'),
    new card('80', 'TREASURE BOX', 'You Have Many Treasures that You Have Buried and Forgotten.  It is Time to Reclaim Them.', 'There are good experiences that you have forgotten. You need to reclaim them. In a current relationship, these can be a source of inspiration. These are like great ideas you have put on the shelf. It is time to take them down, dust them, and use them in your current life. Positive memories are a source of wealth and happiness. There may be someone in your past who “got away.” It is time to take out your book of memories and look for clues. There are gems in your past, and it is time to claim them to find your true happiness.','Guidance: Remember to move closer to who and what you love.'),

You can support each other to be the best that you each can be.  Don’t try to mold the other person into a cookie-cutter copy of you, but instead, look to support each other to unfold each of your gifts. When you unite in body, mind, and spirit, you discover aspects of yourself and each other that you didn’t even know were possible. Unify as a team, supporting each other’s true nature, and you will grow together.', 'Guidance: Recognize the light and love in each other, and you will both become stronger.'),
    new card('82', 'CLINGING', 'Don’t Put All Your Eggs in Another Person’s Basket.', 'It is one thing to connect, it is another to fuse. If you have lost your sense of self and individuality in a relationship, it is time to regain your sense of personal power. Don’t confuse your needs and desires with theirs. This turns the relationship into superglue, causing you to be too attached. Grasping and clenching will stop the flow of love. If you try to hold onto something or someone too tightly, you smother their light. Attempting to control the other person is based on fear, and does not support either of you to be free to truly love.', 'Guidance: Recognize and heal your own fears. Love needs to breathe.'),
    new card('83', 'ALIGNMENT', 'Alignment of Purpose Leads to Harmony in the Relationship.', 'When two people are on parallel journeys, with common values and dreams, it can lead to a beautiful, spiritual union. Peaceful partnering can lead to great connections and projects with big impact. Sometimes these last a lifetime, other times there may be a coming together for a time and then a moving on. There are no guarantees of "forever," but the connection is so meaningful that you should set your fear aside and take this remarkable chance.', 'Guidance: The goal of love is to express love – leave your fears at the door.'),
    new card('84', 'ENCHANTED ENCOUNTER', 'Sometimes People Come Together for a Reason, Sometimes for a Season.', 'Sometimes people come together for healing, for a reason that you can’t always see right now. Co-partnership for a purpose, a cause, a mission can be life-changing. This affinity and alliance is precious. But the alliance may not be on all levels. The danger is to turn this great working relationship into something that it isn’t. The intensity of this connection may not be sustainable forever. Accept the gifts of connection for what they are without trying to make them something they are not.', 'Guidance: Trust that there is a larger purpose unfolding, but don’t try to make it something that it is not.'),
    new card('85', 'SENSITIVITY', 'Your Intuition, Perception, and Sensitivity are Gifts.', 'You need to value your own insights and sensitivities. If you do not honor them you will learn the hard way. But be gentle with expressing your awareness to others, as they may not be ready to hear. Deliver your insights with tender kindness, never as a judgment or criticism. Because this will alienate you from those who are not ready to receive. Sensitivity is a gift and a direct line to the heart, but not everyone’s heart is open.', 'Guidance: With gentle delicacy much more can be accomplished.'),
    new card('86', 'HYPER-SENSITIVITY', 'When You Are Out of Balance Everything Looks Crooked to You.', 'It is easy to feel impatient when you are waiting for someone else to do something – or stop doing something. The irritability comes from the feeling of being out of control. But you can’t control the other person. The only thing you can control is your own reactions. Your reactions are not in symmetry with the situation. This causes you to feel fragile, disturbed, and perturbed. Do not make important decisions from this place.', 'Guidance: Return to center and balance. Don’t make any important decisions until you feel an inner sense of harmony or peace.'),
    new card('87', 'PERSISTENCE', 'Continue On Your Course. Remain Steady and You Will Prevail.', 'If you know what is true for you, then continue on your course, in spite of opposition and difficulty. Don’t let another’s vision supersede your own, even if they are adamant. Do not allow the emotional winds of others to blow you off your course. The storm you see is passing. The truth will prevail if you persist and remain steady. You will know your path is correct if you feel a certain calmness as you contemplate this course of action.', 'Guidance: In the midst of a storm the truth is your lighthouse.'),

But when you become too attached to one view, or one person, you eliminate the field of possibilities. The world is infinitely bigger and better than you are seeing. The Universe wants to bring you what you want, but perhaps not exactly in the way you desire it. Allow the Universe to show you what true love, true beauty, true peace can feel like.  Obstinacy and unreasonableness are very unattractive qualities.  Would you want to live with you when you are at your worst?', 'Guidance: Resistance cuts you off from the flow of infinite possibility.'),
    new card('89', 'GRADUAL WITHDRAWAL', 'The Art of Separation is to Increase the Quality of Love Even in the Process of Moving On.', 'It happens sometimes that human beings grow apart and desire to move on. Perhaps one or both of you sense this need to grow in different ways. Perhaps you have completed an unspoken healing contract with each other. Validate how much you have given each other, and how much more beauty and joy lies ahead. Aspire to kindness and gentleness in this process, but don’t turn away from what you need to do. Love will heal the stages of separation.', 'Guidance: If you leave with love, you will be truly free to move forward. If you leave with wounds, you carry them with you.'),
    new card('90', 'CLEAN BREAK', 'It is Time for a Decisive End. Follow What You Know to Be True.','Speak the truth and don’t waver. It is kinder to leave physically if your heart has already left. If your commitment isn’t there, there will be a constant struggle. You are not doing either of you any favors by staying when you have already left emotionally.  Choose freedom, rather than being trapped by guilt. There comes a time to move on and face your destiny. The past is behind you, the future is ahead. Keep facing forward.', 'Guidance: Love freedom. Guilt entraps both sides and keeps you from moving on.'),
    new card('91', 'DIPLOMACY', 'Speak Your Truth – With Love and Respect for the Other.', 'There is an art to speaking the truth in a way that honors another person. This skill comes from an awareness of the other’s concerns and feelings. Choosing the right time to speak is wise. Tact doesn’t mean lie. It means speaking truthfully while putting the emphasis on maintaining the integrity of the relationship.  Withholding permanently is not a solution. Find a way to express appreciation of the goodness in the other person at the same time that you express your own needs.', 'Guidance: Speak the truth -- in a loving way.'),
    new card('92', 'WITHHOLDING', 'Not Speaking Your Truth is a Slow Poison.', 'Holding back your feelings will cause them to pile up and leads to resentment. At some point they will explode. This is more dangerous than speaking them in the moment. Withholding your true feelings damages your relationship with yourself as well as with your partner. Withholding words leads to withholding emotionally, sexually, and also with your time and attention. Not speaking your truth leads to resentments. Refusing to give your sweetness or fullness leads to feeling angry or empty inside.', 'Guidance: To start the flow of sweet truth, just begin to love again.'),
    new card('93', 'YIN/YANG', 'It is Time to Seek a Balance Between Giving and Receiving.', 'We all have the capacity to give and to receive, but sometimes in a relationship these elements get out of balance. Just as we each have male and female energies within, we need to balance those aspects of our personality within the relationship. Remember that whatever is happening externally is also happening internally. Balance your own inner giver and receiver first, then the external situation will come into balance.', 'Guidance: Find and settle into the center of two extremes. The center is where the harmony is.'),
    new card('94', 'POLARIZATION', 'Opposites Both Attract and Repel. Find the Center Position.', 'We are often drawn to someone who feels opposite us in some way we desire. This is because we haven’t owned that quality in ourselves. The challenge is that the disconnection from this aspect of yourself can turn from attraction to repulsion. A struggle is then created when both sides take extreme/opposite positions. The nature of the Wheel of Experience of Life is that at some point in the journey we will experience the opposite of our current position. Cultivate an appreciation of the middle position between two extremes.', 'Guidance: Harmonize to the core positive essence between the two polarities.'),
    new card('95', 'REFLECTION', 'As Within, So Without. To Change Your Life, Change Your Own Energy Vibration.', 'Life is a mirror of our own internal consciousness. What we believe we deserve is what we get. Change your beliefs about what you truly deserve, and the Universe will change what is delivered. Focus on love and peace and beauty, and you will see more of that around you. Our thoughts and expectations are magnetic, and reproduce themselves in our outer world. Often it is the non-conscious thoughts that have the most magnetism. Listen deeply to what you really believe, and change your thoughts to change your world.', 'Guidance: You are a mirror. Send out love and light and you will see that reflected back to you.'),
    new card('96', 'PERSONALIZING', 'It is a Mistake to Take Everything Personally.', 'It is a discipline of the mind to not interpret everything as a personal reflection of you. People have emotions and reactions based on their own triggers. You can validate their experience as being real to them, even triggered by you, but not as caused by you. Their triggers are a reflection of their past, and their interpretations of those events. You can have compassion for their experience, but don’t take it as your burden. Their emotional experience is not your job to fix. Be gentle, but draw a boundary between their emotional reactions and your own.', 'Guidance: Those who make judgments of others only judge and sentence themselves.'),

If you try to rush, based on your desire to make things happen, you fall out of the flow and move into effort and resistance.  There is a natural rhythm. Don’t expect everything to always be at the same level of intensity. Don’t be afraid of the movement towards and away from intimacy.

Flow requires change, new growth, and momentum. When the flow has been blocked for a long time, the dynamics between you and your partner become unhealthy. You must pull out the plugs, speak your truth, and take new actions to generate healthy movement of energy. Empty yourself of old ideas and beliefs.

This is also about recognizing the “outcast aspects of your true self,” such as not following your dreams.

The emotions, on the other hand, are loud, tumultuous, and overly-stimulated.  Emotions can push you to act, but what you want to do is listen to the quiet guidance that shows a clear path. Look past this immediate situation. How does this action impact your future? Or the future of someone you care about?

You may have different points of view, but find the places where you agree, the core values you share. You can either use your energy to focus on the problem -- or a better choice -- on the solution.', 'Guidance: The solution to most problems is more love.'),
    new card('104', 'RESOLUTION', 'Sometimes the Best Resolution is a Transformation – Rather than Trying to Fix Something that is Broken.', 'It is time to make a decision. In order to know what is best, break down a big problem into its components. This will help you manage the issue and come to a clear and firm determination. In order to know whether a break-up is needed -- or a stronger coming together -- you need to understand the fundamental issues underlying the conflict. There needs to be an internal change, a transformation of patterns and ways of relating to allow a joint journey. If not, it is time to begin your transformation on separate paths. Either way, a decision needs to be made.', 'Guidance: You have to be committed to the process of transformation in order to grow.'),
    new card('105', 'REDUCTION', 'Reduce Your Focus on the Problem.  Don’t Expend Energy in Ways that Don’t Serve You.', 'If you are always focusing on a problem, you become more attached to the conflict. You need to turn your attention to where you want to go, and who you want to be. Where you put your attention is where your energy goes. Always focusing on problems drains your energy, and leaves you with insufficient fuel for change.  Begin to withdraw your identification with the problem. Remember to read between the lines. Actions speak louder than words.', 'Guidance: Discipline yourself to re-focus on solutions, rather than on an obsession with the problem.'),
    new card('106', 'AMPLIFY', 'Express Your Love, and It Will Increase.', 'Don’t hide your love or your light. It may not always return to you in the moment you expect, but it is moving in the right direction. Be brave enough to radiate like a lighthouse, whether or not there are ships in the bay. By adding more attention, focus, and intention to what you love, you will feel more full, more satisfied. Focus and direct your energy to develop or magnify, sustain, and strengthen your love.', 'Guidance: To get more love and better results, dedicate your time, energy, and focus on who or what you love.'),
    new card('107', 'DISCERNMENT', 'It is Time to See what is Actually True, Not What you Hope is True.', 'We all have hopes and dreams to nurture, but there comes a time when we need a reality check. The power of discerning is the key to seeing what is really true about the other person or the situation. Perceive reality as it actually is, instead of through hope or fantasy. It is a good time to exercise clear perception and to recognize the motives of others. You need to evaluate accurately. Otherwise you will either blame yourself for not seeing, or blame the other person for failing to live up to your fantasy.', 'Guidance: The truth shall set you free, but first you have to see it.'),
    new card('108', 'PHANTASMAGORIA', 'Believing the Ideal, and Not Seeing the Real, is a Dangerous Game.', 'If you have a fantasy image of what you hope the other person will be, it is easy to fall in love with the image in your mind. The problem is that the person is real, not ideal. This causes the object of your attention to not truly trust your love and affection. People need to be loved and appreciated for who they are -- the good, the bad, and the ugly. All that glitters is not gold, and glamour can blind the senses.', 'Guidance: Fantasy is fun -- but reality is real – and better.'),
    new card('109', 'TIMING', 'There is Perfect Timing, and There is Wishful Thinking.', 'The coming together of people and projects needs to be with the right timing for both sides. If one side or another isn’t ready, even the perfect relationship/situation may not happen.  Compatibility and timing must be in sync. Use direct words and questions to test the reality of what the other person is feeling. Are they really ready? You may think you are ready, but there may be a greater reality that hasn’t yet been revealed. Trust the perfect timing.', 'Guidance: All things happen in their perfect timing.'),
    new card('110', 'PUSHING', 'Imposing Your Will on Another Will Backfire.', 'If you attempt to force an encounter or event, if the timing isn’t right, even if you “win” temporarily, it will not be sustained. Respect the other’s timing. Your will should not override another’s timing. We all come to love differently and at a different pace. Make sure you are both really on the same page, not just in your mind. If you push and try to accelerate momentum without harmony, it will only backfire.', 'Guidance: It is better to allow reality to blossom than to force a demonstration of your will that may not be sustainable.'),
    new card('111', 'CHALLENGE', 'A Challenge is an Invitation to Grow.', 'If you are facing a challenge, how you respond to this challenge will determine whether it is a positive or negative experience. Especially if someone you care about is presenting you with this challenge, you may be at first tempted to resist. This is a call to overcome your own fears, doubts, concepts, beliefs. If you believe this person has your best interests at heart, be brave. Confront and encounter this opportunity to grow. Dare to question old ways. Why stay the same when you can accept a challenge which leads to growth and excitement ahead?', 'Guidance: You are ready to grow. Accept the challenge.'),
    new card('112', 'OVERWHELM', 'The Flood of Emotions is Clouding Your Vision.', 'When you have too many feelings at once it is easy to feel defeated and trapped in an uphill struggle. This state can lead to feeling helpless or powerless. This victim mentality is a vicious cycle that keeps you trapped in feelings of dependency on another. Being in the victim mode is very unattractive to a healthy partner. Even if you feel you have been hurt, don’t get stuck seeing yourself as a victim. Instead of waiting and hoping for someone to rescue you, what is one small step you can take to find your own power?', 'Guidance: Rescue yourself. Don’t wait for someone else to do it.'),
    new card('113', 'SURRENDER', 'Let Go of Wanting to Control Everything and Everybody.', 'Let go of wanting to be right. This only leads to the other person wanting to be as right as you want to be. These keep you both locked in a combative mode, which leaves little room for positive feelings, attraction, and love. Choose to release the issue, rather than fight to the death. Fighting always leaves injuries on both sides. Who wants to love someone who has just beaten them into submission? Ultimately you respect neither yourself for your aggressive behavior, nor the other person for submitting to it.', 'Guidance: When you surrender, love and freedom are the rewards. When you fight to the end, no one wins.'),
    new card('114', 'SACRIFICE', 'Don’t Give Up on Your Intrinsic Needs.', 'If you give up on yourself – you can’t blame the other person.  Relinquishing your power in the relationship is going to leave you feeling like a victim, endlessly fighting the wrong battles. It is one thing to surrender to the process of love, it is another to sacrifice yourself and your basic needs. You deserve to be loved for who you are. The price of over-self-sacrificing of basic self-expression is too high, and will backfire down the line. This will result in losing your self-respect and even the respect of your partner.', 'Guidance: Respect yourself. Give from fullness, not emptiness.'),
    new card('115', 'CHANGING TIDES', 'The Tides Rise and Fall. Do Not Get Attached to Any Particular Fluctuation.', 'There are periods of change and fluctuation, as in the cycles of high and low tides. It is wise to recognize the phase of the tide, but not to be confused into thinking that any one phase is the permanent truth. Do not confuse a temporary moment with the “final answer.” Emotions are like tides -- they come and go, rise and fall. You have to watch a few cycles of the tides before you can determine where the center is. Adjust your thinking to accommodate the lack of solidity that is presenting itself.', 'Guidance: Sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride.'),
    new card('116', 'ANCHOR', 'A Weight is Holding You in Place.', 'Old ideas, hopes, and beliefs can keep you trapped because you think this is the way things “should” be. You have a concept of what a “perfect relationship” should look and feel like.  Sometimes you have to let go of outdated ideas in order to recognize something even better. It may give the illusion of safety to hang on to something old and solid. But in truth it is dangerous to cling to something and never move, because life will pass you by. Allow yourself to view new possibilities, new solutions, and new horizons.', 'Guidance: By having an open mind you allow new possibilities and opportunities to present themselves.'),
    new card('117', 'DETACHMENT', 'Detach Yourself from Other People’s Issues – and Focus On the Solution.', 'Don’t get caught up in other people’s dramas, pains, fears, judgments. When you care about someone, it is easy to become entangled in their ups and downs. This is not healthy for you.  Free yourself from their entanglements. Don’t identify with your partner’s issues and complaints. You have your own truth. Let go of buying into their perceptions of obstacles. Your job is to hold your focus steady on the real goal.', 'Guidance: Keep your focus on goals, and not on the obstacles.'),
    new card('118', 'DISASSOCIATION', 'You Have Gotten Separated From Your Own Feelings.', 'If you get separated from your heart, from your true feelings, you feel disconnected from everyone and everything. You have separated yourself too far, and feel lost. Begin to reconnect with what feels good, and right, and true. Don’t allow someone else’s moral or emotional compass to replace your own sense of right and wrong. This will begin to allow you to connect first with your own heart, and then with the heart of another. If you try to skip this step of reconnecting with your own truth, you will feel like nothing is working.', 'Guidance: Self Love is the antidote for the pain of the sense of separation.'),
    new card('119', 'TRUTHFULNESS', 'Kindness Makes the Truth Easier to Hear.', 'It is very important to speak the truth – the whole truth. And it is just as important to speak with kindness, as that is what allows a message to be heard. Having a simultaneous awareness of what you need to say – and how a person can receive it, is an art. This kindness allows the person to not be so defensive that their ears close. Find your desire to be authentic, while at the same time be willing to consider the other person’s feelings.', 'Guidance: First feel your love, then speak the truth from that love.'),
    new card('120', 'NAKED TRUTH', 'Truth is Not Meant to Be a Weapon.', 'If you are using your truth as a hidden weapon to hurt or judge another, this will tear at the fabric of trust in a relationship. Beware of hidden judgments, comparisons, or insensitive comments. Timing is important when choosing to speak about difficult issues. Respect a person’s privacy and boundaries, and choose your moment wisely. Remember that truth is relative – what is “true” from your perspective may be very different from someone else’s. Even if it is the opposite of yours, try to find the element of validity in their version of reality.', 'Guidance: If there is judgment (hidden) in your words, they aren’t the truth -- they are opinions.'),
    new card('121', 'REMARKABLE MEETINGS', 'Sometimes a Person Comes Into Our Lives to Rejuvenate our Hearts.', 'It can be a very powerful experience to have a meeting of the mind, heart, body, and soul. Sometimes we connect with another for healing and awakening. As powerful as these encounters are, they are not necessarily destined to be a permanent partnership. Sometimes this is a past life connection, and there is a powerful experience of reuniting, but do not idealize this person. Like meeting the Buddha on the road, learn what you need to, get the gifts from the encounter, and continue on your path.', 'Guidance: Love always has a purpose -- though not always the one you thought it would be.'),
    new card('122', 'THE MIRAGE', 'It is Easy to Think the Grass is Greener Somewhere Else, But When You Get Closer, It is the Same.', 'Sometimes someone appears who seems to be everything that you are missing. It is easy to look at someone else’s relationship and imagine that they have a perfect one, or that their partner is the one for you. If there is a quality you admire in another, how can you use this as an opportunity to develop more of that quality within yourself? When the perfect charmer appears you can enjoy the gifts they have to offer, but don’t be seduced into thinking they are something that they are not.', 'Guidance: Mermaids and mer-men will eventually slip back into the sea.'),
    new card('123', 'SINCERITY', 'Have Faith and Trust What is Real.', 'Honesty is the best policy. Words spoken from the heart and actions taken from love will heal wounds. Being straightforward and genuine is the right thing to do, even if someone has not done the right thing to you. Even if what they have done is rotten, let go of past hurts. Allow present reality to fill your horizon. People make mistakes, and they can recognize that. If what you are hearing, seeing, and feeling feels right, and rings true, then trust that their motives are heartfelt.', 'Guidance: Speak the truth -- and act in accordance with this truth -- and all will be well.'),
    new card('124', 'SIMULATE', 'Going Through the Motions, Pretending to Feel Something You Don’t, Makes You Feel like an Imposter.', 'To pretend, or feign interest, or to fake love weakens you because you are not being authentic with yourself or the other person. Pretending to feel a certain way, causes you to make excuses to yourself or to another. Then you are lying, which eats away at your self-esteem. Maybe someone else has caught your attention. Even if something looks good on the outside, if on the inside it is rotten you will likely be poisoned.', 'Guidance: All that glitters is not gold.'),
    new card('125', 'JOY', 'Celebrate! Life is Good. You Deserve All the Joy You Are Willing to Feel.', 'Your spirit is ready to soar. It is time to really enjoy the goodness of life. In the past you haven’t allowed yourself to fully let this in, and that has kept it at a distance. Now you can truly express and accept this feeling. Rejoice in the potential of real happiness. Celebrate! You deserve all the good that life has to offer. Joy will transport you into deeper and deeper levels of rapture. Your spirit wants to soar. Find the sublime pleasure in ordinary moments and share it with another.', 'Guidance: To enjoy life, live a life in joy.'),
    new card('126', 'SUGAR HIGH', 'Don’t Get Addicted to the Instant Rush, Because There Will Always Be the Crash.', 'High intensity, roller-coaster riding, and short-term pleasure can lead to a crash at the end of the ride. Recognize the pleasurable experience for what it is – a short ride. There’s nothing wrong with an occasional sugar high -- it’s the addiction to the "instant rush" that causes the crash. Who isn’t attracted to a giddy burst of energy and excitement? But are you willing to pay the price of a high-ticket ride? Make sure the emotional cost is worth the temporary thrill.', 'Guidance: Happiness is in the balance, not in the pursuit of intensity.'),
    new card('127', 'SATISFACTION', 'Balanced Gratification Means that other Aspects of Your Health and Well-Being are not Jeopardized.', 'True contentment is different from instant gratification. You need to be really clear about what it is that truly makes you happy. What is it that makes you feel full from the inside? Not knowing causes the search to try to get someone else to fulfill your needs, expectations, and wishes. Good luck with that! No one can really “make” us feel happy – unless we are willing to be happy first. Recognize your heartfelt desires, and pursue them in a balanced way. This is what leads to an enduring path of satisfaction.','Guidance: Take pleasure in what you have, and be grateful. '),
    new card('128', 'FUTILITY', 'You Are Giving Away Too Much of Yourself.', 'It is a wonderful thing to give to another. But if giving and receiving are not balanced, it can feel fruitless. If you keep pouring water into a vessel with a hole at the bottom, all of your good energy drains away. You must first make sure you have what you need, including time, space, and renewal of energy. Never give from emptiness, because that only depletes you so much that you have nothing left for either of you. You have beautiful love to give – you just need to offer it to the right person.','Guidance: If you pour yourself into someone or something with holes, they will never be filled and you will be depleted.'),
    new card('129', 'INNER JOY', 'The Source of Real Joy is Within.', 'If you seek water from an empty well, you will be disappointed – and thirsty. It is time to find your deeper connection to what brings you joy, instead of looking for cheap thrills from someone else. Giving your power to someone else to make you happy is a strategy that is bound to fail. You end up resenting them for not “making” you happy, and you feel hopeless about ever finding the elusive happiness you seek. Change your love strategy. Find your own path to joy and follow that. You will create what you truly desire – a reliable path to happiness.', 'Guidance: The only thing you can depend on is within you.'),
    new card('130', 'EMERGENCE', 'Don’t Hide Your Love – Instead Reveal It.', 'If you hide your love, your beauty, your talents, you can’t be surprised if no one sees you. It is time to honor your own gifts and emerge as who you are. Lift the veils that you have surrounded yourself with. Take a risk and express your true self. Not everyone will respond, but it will help you to live a more authentic life. And, in time, the right person will be attracted to your sense of self. Claim your right to be you and to be loved for who you are. Be willing to be yourself and be seen.',  'Guidance: Reveal yourself to yourself -- and then to the world.'),
    new card('131', 'THE CHALICE', 'Keep the Love-Energy Flowing.', 'As long as the energy of love is flowing, trust that it will continue. But blocked emotions like fear cause you to shut it down and try to stop the flow. Step back into the trust – not of the person – but of your own ability to love. If you have been thrown, don’t give up. Get back on the horse. Jump back into the flow, lean into it, and allow it to happen. Fear contracts love, so even if you have been hurt, it is time to expand your heart and to love again.', 'Guidance: You deserve the loving energy that wants to come to you.'),
    new card('132', 'EMPTY CUP', 'Allow Yourself to Receive the Love that Seeks to Come Your Way.', 'You have been pouring too much energy out, and this causes an imbalance. It is time to allow your cup to refill. Ask yourself: “What truly nourishes me emotionally and spiritually?” You need to spend some time focusing on what really makes you feel whole, full, content. If you take some time out for yourself, you will be more ready, able, and willing to give to another. Instead of seeing yourself or others as broken, see the perfection in you as well as in them. This will make you feel whole and ready to receive again.', 'Guidance: Seek a balance of giving and receiving.'),
    new card('133', 'CHANGE', 'To Rewrite the Script of Your Life – Just Change Your Mind.', 'It is time to transform old habits, patterns, and beliefs. They are what have caused your present circumstances. To make a difference in your world, you need new, fresh perspectives.

Now is the time to rewrite the script of your life to read the way you want it to.', 'Guidance: The most important change is your mind.'),
    new card('134', 'UNSTABLE', 'Things Are Uncertain, Therefore Don’t Become Attached to An Unstable Foundation.', 'Of course, you don’t like uncertainty. But becoming more attached to the source of uncertainty does not make it more stable. It just means that you are more vulnerable to the fickle, mutable, unsteady whims of another. If someone has shown that they are irresolute, capricious, volatile, fluctuating, or unsettled, why expect anything different? The only place you can rely on certainty is inside your own heart. Instead of seeking stability in another, begin to navigate by your own inner truth, not someone else’s fluctuating desires.','Guidance: If you haven’t determined your course, you can’t very well chart it.'),
    new card('135', 'THE ARK', 'Listening to the Guidance of Your Heart Can Help You Weather the Storm.', 'If you feel a storm is coming, don’t ignore this message. Listen to your heart and pay attention to what you know deep down inside. While your emotions will spin you around and around, the still quiet voice inside will tell you -- simply, truthfully -- what you need to see. If your emotions are pounding you, write them down, letting each one pour out the intensity on paper. Listen to each one. Then wait for calmer waters before taking action. If you feel each emotion, one by one, they won’t pile up or flood you.', 'Guidance: What you are willing to feel, you can heal.'),

You can gain strength and courage by surviving adversity. But rather than trying to barrel through every experience, you can begin to really listen to your heart’s message. When it comes to finding the right partner, take a closer look at your own patterns of attraction. Begin to re-chart your course and navigate toward ease. This will allow you to pay attention to the warning signs and make better choices.', 'Guidance: Next time listen to your heart -- choose to learn the easy way.'),
    new card('137', 'THUNDER', 'Sudden Wake-Up Calls are Hard – But They Clear the Air.', 'Nobody likes a rude awakening. It is a hard jolt, but the purpose is to get you to make a change. To wake up and hear the thunder. Breathe and calm yourself through this short-term adversity and fear, knowing that this too shall pass. Someone may give you some shocking or disturbing news. Don’t look away and put your head in the sand. Listen, and adjust rather than deny what you are hearing.

Remember to refocus on the big picture. Even if you have been hurt, you can heal. It is time to shed your old skin and express your passion and creativity.

    new card('140', 'PROJECTION', 'You Can’t Expect Others to Guarantee Your Happiness.', 'The idea that someone else is responsible for your happiness is a dangerous idea. If you put anyone in the position of being your savior, then they are also in the position of being your jailor. The fault is in assigning them the role of being in charge of your happiness. You imagine that they will act a certain way, and when they don’t, you are unhappy. It is your expectations that are creating land mines. You need to see them and appreciate them for who they are, not from what you hope they will be for you.', 'Guidance: Claim your own desires. Become the person you are seeking.'),
    new card('141', 'LOYALTY', 'First be Faithful to Yourself', 'To Your Core Values and Your Sense of Rightness.', 'It is easy to be loyal when you are in alignment and the partnership is mutually rewarding. When you feel out of sync with your partner, it is difficult to remain loyal, because you are out of sync with your own sense of right and wrong. True loyalty should support you both to be authentic so that you can be honest with each other. Without feelings of allegiance, fidelity is hard to maintain. Address any hidden feelings of discord. True loyalty supports the well-being of both sides and is not restrictive like the blinders on a horse’s head.', 'Guidance: To be true to anyone else, you must first be true to yourself.'),

When it is time to stop, stop! When it is time to go, GO! It is not a case of right or wrong, but of paying attention to a harmonious rhythm. Instead of imposing your desires on a timeline, you need to feel the true dynamic interplay of readiness and waiting. This will allow you to take the most appropriate actions, reflecting the best choices in a moment-by-moment flow.', 'Guidance: Everything changes. Cultivate patience, which leads to the wisdom to see clearly.'),
    new card('144', 'TRAPPED IN TIME', 'Heal Your Relationship to Time, and Life Will Become Easier.', 'Being stuck in time leads to feeling restless, then blaming your discomfort on other people or situations. Trying to outrace time is futile and destructive. Although you feel you are trapped in time, it is based on a faulty relationship to time where you believe that it is external rather than internal. Time is about choices. The choices you make determine what “time” you have. Don’t complain about not having enough time, or lost time or that time is passing you by. Instead, ask what new choices would open time.', 'Guidance: Focus on your purpose, and choose to spend your time accordingly, and barriers will begin to fade away.'),

It’s one thing to occasionally help someone, it’s another thing to always come running, as this perpetuates their helplessness.

    new card('146', 'THE VICTIM', 'It is Time to Release the Pattern of Helplessness and the Hope of Being Rescued.', 'Make a powerful decision to shift this old pattern of needing to be saved. It is a passive form of controlling others because you keep each other stuck in roles that no longer serve you. Occasionally we all need a hand, but when it becomes a pattern, it can be destructive and not conducive to mature love and intimacy. Recognize the ways in which you volunteer to be the victim, and start making better choices.', 'Guidance: You have the power -- to choose not to perpetuate the victim game any longer.'),

As you rebalance your energies outward, you will feel more secure, fulfilled, and capable.

Receiving is first about being open and willing to receive. If the door to your heart is slammed shut, nothing and no one can enter. Abundance works magnetically, attracting to itself more of the same. Just as hate attracts more hate, love attracts more love. So, be the person you want to be, let your heart energy flow, express your truth, and be ready to have it all.

    new card('154', 'WANDERER', 'Restless Roaming Can Only Quench a Temporary Thirst.', 'Straying and meandering seem like exciting motions. But true momentum is different – because it is moving toward something you truly want. Unless you are changing your pattern, you are not making any real progress. Changing one lover for another, without changing yourself, is not progress. Too many lovers can make you feel aimless, disconnected. Bed hopping from one partner to another is like a rock tumbling down a hill. The motion may titillate you. But giving your energy to many is a random motion that leaves you feeling empty inside.', 'Guidance: It can feel good to just go with the flow, but sometimes you also need to steer.'),
    new card('155', 'ADAPTABLE', 'With Flexibility Comes Joy and Freedom.', 'The ability to adjust to different circumstances, needs, and changing times makes you someone everyone wants to be around. If you are easy-going, you are easy to get along with. Instead of digging in your heels and trying to get others to stay the same, celebrate change and growth. Blend and harmonize with the new wind that is blowing. Rigidity just creates more suffering for yourself and others.  Feel the joy of fluidity and you will flourish.', 'Guidance: It is wise to bend in the wind rather than be rigid and risk breaking like an old twig.'),
    new card('156', 'CONFORMITY', 'Too Much Wanting Approval from Others Causes You to Compromise Your Truth.', 'While it is nice to want to please others, if this becomes imbalanced you end up trying to jump through so many hoops you have no energy left for your own dreams. Adapting to everyone else’s wishes, to the point of losing oneself or losing touch with one’s own needs, is unwise. Being so worried about what others think of you is counter-productive. Don’t be so afraid to rock the boat that you stay on the dock. Undue acquiescence undermines your personal power and leaves you angry at the world.', 'Guidance: Do the world a favor -- Be Yourself!'),
    new card('157', 'RAPTURE', 'Love at the Highest Octave Possible, and It Will Elevate You Both.', 'Pure love can transport you to another level of joy and ecstasy so it becomes a spiritual experience. You can experience profound pleasure as the angels know it. This comes from the experience of the Oneness of All Life. Sublime joy and delight in the higher levels of enjoyment go way beyond simply physical gratification. Find the source of Joy within, and you will feel full. Your life will be touched by this experience forever.', 'Guidance: When we delight in each other, we make the angels smile.'),
    new card('158', 'RESISTANCE', 'There is a Flow that Wants to Happen – Don’t Fight the Flow.', 'If you refuse to accept or resist the flow of energy, you block your own potential. Refusing to allow the process and flow of change weakens you. Instead of being in the way of change, get into the groove of its momentum. You can steer it in ways that work well for you. But stubbornly opposing change will make you very unappealing. Let go of trying to create unnecessary difficulty for yourself. The more you fight it the more it stays stuck, and the more you are stuck with it.', 'Guidance: What you resist, persists.'),
    new card('159', 'GRADUAL PROGRESSION', 'Everyone’s Timing is Different.', 'Some people move slower than others. But like the tortoise and the hare, there is no guarantee in speed. If anything, trust the slow and steady progress toward your goal. Rather than trying to force a relationship to move deeper or faster, remember that everyone moves at a pace that works for them. If you force someone to commit sooner than they are ready, they will feel trapped. Movement and progress may appear to be slow, but it is occurring, nonetheless. Be patient with the other’s progress.  Their pace may be different than yours.', 'Guidance: Everyone’s timing is perfect for them, so don’t allow your own impatience to ruin things.'),

Listen to your heart and pay attention to what you need to do. If you have been in waiting mode, it is time to move forward. This is the time to direct your destiny by taking bold and decisive action.  You want to move with wisdom, not impetuousness, but be brave.  Then act wisely. Even if you don’t feel completely ready for change, you will become ready in the process of moving forward.', 'Guidance: If you come from the heart, you can move mountains.'),
    new card('161', 'ACCEPTANCE', 'Say Yes!  Open Your Heart and Mind to New Possibilities.', 'It is time to accept yourself – for exactly who you are. Instead of judging yourself, approve of yourself. If you can accept yourself for the goodness of who you are, you will have room for everyone else’s unique journey. Let go of past judgments and perceptions. Be in "Yes Mode," ready to receive the good people and things that want to come your way. Let go of what is false, and be brave enough to accept what is present right now – what is real.

If you create this perfect image of your beloved, you are putting them on a pedestal. Eventually, he or she will feel alone there -- or will crash and fall -- on you! Fantasies are not real, so instead see your beloved as who they really are. If you create a perfect image of a person in your mind, they are bound to disappoint you. Allow this prince/princess to come down from the lonely pedestal, and accept him/her as the actual being -- perfectly imperfect -- that they are.', 'Guidance: Trust that if you let go of the fantasy you will gain something even more Divine.'),
    new card('163', 'SHARING', 'Open Your Heart and Let Someone In.', 'To have real intimacy you must share something of yourself. To go deeper in a relationship you must each allow yourselves to be truly seen. Give yourself more fully, and you will receive more fully. Being in a relationship where the partners are not allowing themselves to really be seen will feel empty. Take baby steps, but keep moving toward greater honesty and integrity.  Releasing judgments will encourage your partner to open up and trust their heart to yours. Keep the flow of heart-full communication going to increase the level of intimacy.', 'Guidance: If you want more -- give more.'),

You may think you can juggle it all, but when your emotions are dispersed, your strength is diluted.  Your integrity is compromised if you find yourself having to make up stories or please too many people. Remember that too much pursuit of pleasure can cause you to feel the opposite, the suffering that comes from insatiable emptiness and dissipation of your energy.', 'Guidance: If you split yourself in two, both halves suffer.'),
    new card('165', 'NEUTRALITY', 'Being Able to See Both Sides Leads to Balance.', 'If you are not attached to a particular result, you can see both sides of any issue. Rather than digging in your heels and fighting for a specific outcome, try seeing it from the other person’s point of view. This will allow a solution to emerge. Forcing resolution without taking into account both sides will not end in a stable outcome. Power moves may create temporary gains, but at the expense of long-term stability and mutuality.', 'Guidance: You can’t judge anything or anybody until you have an understanding of both points of view.'),
    new card('166', 'INDIFFERENCE', 'Emotional Withdrawal Does Not Allow Relationships to Flourish.','If someone isn’t caring, the relationship is relegated to mediocrity. Lack of interest or concern for the other person’s needs will cause the relationship to wither and die. Communication is to a relationship what water is to plants. All flowers need nourishment, and all relationships need the continual nurturing and presence of an emotionally committed partner. Are you withholding emotions and communication with your partner? Take a chance and speak your truth.', 'Guidance: Loving something brings the life back into it.'),
    new card('167', 'WANTING CONTROL', 'Trying to Control Reality Keeps You from Enjoying It.', 'If you believe that you have no control, trying to control the other person is your worst strategy. Nobody likes to be controlled by another. It is unattractive and causes people to resist. It is both an illusion that you can have control, as well as an illusion that you are out of control. You can’t control anyone else’s feelings, reactions, habits, or desires. The only thing you have some control over is your own reactivity. Work on managing your own responses, and don’t push the other person away because of your controlling fears.', 'Guidance: Let go of wanting control -- and see how easy life gets.'),
    new card('168', 'WANTING APPROVAL', 'Relying on Other People’s Approval Before You Feel Good About Yourself is a Losing Game.', 'Let go of seeking and needing approval from external sources that can’t/won’t give it to you. Wanting, searching and struggling for approval keeps it away. It is time to release the belief that you don’t deserve love. These feelings may be familiar, but they have expired as useful principles to run your life. Find your source of approval from within, and others will be more attracted to the calm power of self-love.', 'Guidance: Allow yourself to feel the love you are seeking.'),
    new card('169', 'SELF-ESTEEM', 'Believe in Yourself and Others Will Also.', 'If you don’t think you are worthy of love you will push it away -- to prove you are right about your flaws. Instead of investing in what is wrong with you, start to really own your goodness.  Once you accept yourself, others will want to be around you.  Stand up for your own feelings, desires, and point of view.  Speak your truth. Support yourself by believing in yourself.  Until you really believe you are lovable, no one else will be able to convince you that you are.', 'Guidance: Love yourself, and others will do the same.'),
    new card('170', 'PIN CUSHION', 'Stop Allowing Others to Use You as Their Pin Cushion.', 'It is time to stop allowing others to use and abuse you. Sitting still while others push their pins into your ideas, your plans, your hopes, and dreams, is not healthy. Being hurt has become familiar and safe in its own way. Break this pattern by not letting those who don’t appreciate your gifts continue to use you for their needs. Begin to value yourself, your feelings and your ideas, and you will begin to attract others who do the same.', 'Guidance: Stand up for yourself and people will stop walking all over you.'),
    new card('171', 'AUTHENTICITY', 'Live Your Life with Authenticity to Be Happy.', 'To live a life of authenticity and integrity, you must begin by honoring yourself. This means to stop ignoring your talents and gifts. Practice telling the person you love what is true for you. If you can’t be truthful in your relationship, it is the wrong relationship. If you are not being honest about what is most important to you, you will feel compromised, and the relationship will suffer. First face the truth yourself, then find ways to act in accordance with that truth. The rest will take care of itself.', 'Guidance: To thine own self - be true -- and if that doesn’t work for the other person, find the exit sign.'),
    new card('172', 'HARMFUL WORDS', 'Hurtful Judgments Turn “Truth” Into a Weapon, and That Is Not What Truth Was Designed For.', 'Words can harm or heal. If you or someone else is using “insightful” criticism to undermine or belittle, then this is a misuse of the art of communication. This is a power play tactic and is not conducive to tending the garden of love. Putting yourself or others down never helps to build anything. Words should be chosen carefully, which doesn’t mean lie, but instead seek to find ways to reach and connect to the listener in ways that they can hear. This is the Art of communication.', 'Guidance: Truth used as a weapon creates more wounds.'),
    new card('173', 'FIDELITY', 'When You Match Your Actions to Your Words You Are Honoring the Relationship.', 'You must accurately know your true feelings before you can promise anything to anyone else. Sincerity is everything, so going through the motions just because you promised something is not an effective long-term strategy. Being faithful is a very desirable quality, but it must be based on first being authentic about what you really feel. Once you are clear about what you are really feeling inside your heart, you can begin to speak truthfully and take actions that reflect these promises.', 'Guidance: To be faithful to anyone or anything, you must first be faithful to your true self.'),
    new card('174', 'COMPLIANCE', 'Don’t Just Go Along With the Game Plan if it Is The Wrong Game.','Sticking to something just for the sake of sticking to it can be a form of entrapment. If you are not being true to your real feelings, needs, and desires, then you run the risk of becoming submissive. Meekly going along with a game plan when you never knew or agreed to the rules is a ticket to disappointment and despair. Find and listen to your own truth, then develop a plan to move toward it. It is okay to go at a pace that is comfortable for you. But do not allow yourself to remain in negative stagnation.', 'Guidance: False compliance drains you of your passion and your spirit.'),
    new card('175', 'SINCERITY', 'Make Sure that You Say What You Mean, and Act on What You Say.','For love to flourish both partners must come from the heart.  That means that they are genuine and honest about what they need, and are pure in their intentions with each other. Honesty can only be earned by speaking about mixed feelings, admitting to fears and doubts. Being earnest about seeking a solution to these “intruders” is the next step. Seek a greater congruence between your thoughts, words, and actions through creating a safe place to share even dark feelings.', 'Guidance: Admit to yourself what is really true -- then speak from your truthful place.'),
    new card('176', 'MIXED MESSAGES', 'Having Opposing Feelings at the Same Time Creates Mixed Messages.', 'From time to time, everyone has mixed feelings which create mixed messages. But allowing these messages, or unanswered questions, to go on for too long, can create confusion and pain. Seek clarity about each separate, even conflicted feeling. You can love someone, and not like a certain aspect of their behavior.  These contradictions do not cancel each other out, rather they are part of the texture of real human beings. Develop tolerance, and a method for discussing this in a healthy, non-judgmental manner. Otherwise turmoil will emerge.', 'Guidance: Recognize that opposite feelings can exist simultaneously, and be gentle with that knowledge.'),
    new card('177', 'THE WAVE', 'Focus on the Panoramic View. The Steadiness Amid the Waves.', 'Once the high tide of emotions recedes, you can see more possibilities. When it is emotionally high tide, the only thing you can see is the huge immediate wave. Stand further back on the shore. Watch and wait and choose your best moment for actions. Focusing on your goals instead of the annoying details will allow you to have an overall perspective. Seeing the big picture will help you and your partner find the greater harmony, once you’ve both achieved a calmer, lower emotional undertow. The truth is greater than the sum of the problems.', 'Guidance: Forgive, and you will find the flow.'),
    new card('178', 'THE PARTICLE', 'Pay Attention to the Smallest Details for the Biggest Success.','You have big dreams and goals. That is good, but you want to pay attention to the small signs and details. They leave important clues that you may be tempted to overlook because you have the “end game” in view. But the devil is hiding in the details. Make sure you are paying attention to the small indicators of the real truth – not just what you hope is true.  It is also important to not ignore the good moments. So don’t forget to smell the roses along the way. Appreciate the small day-to-day nuances of your partner – to build a solid future.', 'Guidance: Greatness comes when the small moments are in order.'),

The first step to healing may be to first own the pain or sadness. There are gifts hidden in the sadness and messages that you need to pay attention to. So take this time to listen to your heart, to hear what you have been ignoring. Take all the time you need – and then let go of the pain. If you become overly attached to sadness and grief it can become a habit that bars you from the gifts that lay ahead.', 'Guidance: Feel your feelings, listen to their guidance – and then let them go.'),

But there is a time to grieve and a time to release. It is time to begin to live again. Carrying the pain like a heavy burden does not serve you. It keeps new love away. Know that you deserve love and joy now. Listen to your heart and learn what you can from the past. This will help you make better choices in the future. It is time to move on. You have suffered enough!', 'Guidance: It is time to be free again.'),
    new card('181', 'REVERSAL', 'Switching Roles is Not the Same as Freedom.', 'Sometimes we switch sides or roles and wish to experience the opposite of the way we have been treated. For example, if we were hurt, either in childhood or later in a relationship, we will turn around and hurt someone else as we have been hurt. If you have been hurt, ask yourself honestly if you are repeating this pattern with someone else. Are you playing opposite sides of the hurting coin? If we have been cheated upon, then we cheat on another. We are thus playing the opposite part, but haven’t healed the pattern of cheating.', 'Guidance: Even if you flip over to the opposite side of the coin, it’s still the same coin.'),
    new card('182', 'KARMA', 'What Goes Around Comes Around, So Choose Well.', 'This is the Golden Rule. Treat others the way you want to be treated. Choose your thoughts, words, and actions with the awareness that what we do returns to us. If your intentions are for the highest good, then good will result. It isn’t always immediate, but there is a circle of balance that will express itself. When love is flowing, love will be returned, but not always on your timetable. But it will return.', 'Guidance: Be the lover you want to be – love will be returned in time.'),

If you give too much, you may push the other person away. If you express too much, you may rush the other person, who may balk – or walk away. If you are doing all the giving or all the initiating, you will create an imbalance. Seek balance through awareness of the other person’s feelings and timing, in order to keep within appropriate and reasonable limits. Eliminate demands on your partner for their time, their emotions, or their commitments before they are ready.', 'Guidance: Balance is the goal. Not too much, not too little.'),

If you hold back forever, you will lose the chance to really experience the greatness you could be experiencing. Trying to control the outcome through repressing your feelings leaves you stuck, feeling confined. Don’t be so reserved in expressing your feelings. Take more risks in being yourself. Shutting down your emotions is an old strategy that won’t protect you any longer.  Not being true to yourself is like holding back the juices of life.', 'Guidance: Allow yourself to be yourself. That is the only way to be happy.'),

The Universe is trying to reach you and you are ready for love. You’re ready now, you’ve done your emotional homework.

All you need to do is declare that you are free from the negative patterns that once had you in their grip. Welcome to the present! You are prepared, and graduation is in order.

Listen deeply, as you do not want to be yanked around by temporary, casual, or purely sexual desires.  Make sure that it is the heart that is longing. There is an ancient call trying to get your attention. When you connect with that, you will know that this is the right path. Then your feelings will impel you forward. Strong wishes carry instructions, but you must slow down to hear clearly.', 'Guidance: Listen to your deepest desires. They will lead you home.'),
    new card('188', 'CRAVING', 'The Hunger You Feel Must Be Unmasked.', 'Unsatisfied needs can create tremendous craving, but you must question the hunger. It can be generated from many levels and may have less to do with present longing. The intensity of the desire may be coming from the accumulation of unmet needs. This can make it difficult to fulfill in the present because the hunger comes from long ago. If you just act from the craving, it can cause behavior that doesn’t support your ultimate good. Satisfying a craving may not fill a deeper need, thus you lock yourself into a repetitive search for satisfaction.', 'Guidance: Ask yourself: "What do I really want?"...and keep asking.'),

If you are not honest with yourself, you cannot be truly intimate with another. Start with the self-searching innocence of being honest with yourself. That truthfulness is what can lead to purity of the heart and mind. If you are convoluted, with a variety of feelings, it makes your motives unclear. Your agenda becomes complex, and feelings on both sides become bruised. Guilt seeps in and everyone suffers. Speak the truth and it shall set you free.', 'Guidance: Pure truth is your essence. All the rest is baggage.'),
    new card('190', 'CHASTITY', 'True Chastity is Freedom From Illusion.', 'True chastity is purity of heart. This means that you have faith in goodness -- your own and that of another.

Being afraid of being touched because of judgments about what is "clean", "right", "spiritual", etc., can lead to false attachments and fake images of purity. What you need to be chaste or loyal to is your own truth. If you are really listening to your heart, and not just driven by desire, you will be led correctly. Your purity will not be compromised.', 'Guidance: Purity is a state of mind. It is your innate truth.'),

Being afraid to commit – is a decision. You are here, but not here. You are going through the motions – sometimes with much intensity – but your heart is not fully engaged. If you are always just trying things on for size, you will go home naked.  Decide what you really want, and give it your all.

Remaining passive and inactive is a form of making a decision, but not an active one. Even if you are not reacting on the surface, you are feeling emotions.  Don’t ignore them -- as they are clues to what is really important to you. Listening to your heart’s deepest desires, and expressing them in words, will make you less at the mercy of others who have stronger goals and emotions. Stand up for your ideas, for yourself, and your true desires. Don’t allow others to run the show of your life.','Guidance: Passivity is quiet resistance -- to your own strength.'),
    new card('194', 'RESISTANCE', 'Ask: What Is It I Truly Want?', 'Whether you are struggling overtly or subtly – whether it is an inner battle or an outer battle – the resistance is keeping you trapped. What you think you are fighting about is not really the issue. You need to ask yourself what you really want and need. What is really at stake in your fight?

Everyone moves to the beat of their own heart and in their own time. If you use too much pressure on another, they may comply at first. But eventually, they will resent your exertion of force over their free will. Don’t let a false sense of power make you believe you have earned their love. Attacks, either verbal or physical, are a misuse of power, and will ultimately harm you.', 'Guidance: The price of the misuse of power is a loss of love.'),
    new card('197', 'TIGER’S TAIL', 'Speak the Truth – But With Tact and Caution.', 'Be careful how you tread on a tiger’s tail. You may not realize the power of your words, and dangerous situations call for caution and tact. How you say something makes all the difference in the world. Speak the truth, but find the appropriate time. First clear your emotions, so that your message can be heard. If your emotions are at a high charge, the person may only hear your emotional charge, and not the message you intend to share. The Wise One treads very carefully through an emotional mind field.', 'Guidance: Make sure you are clear before you speak the hard truth.'),

Respect true feelings, but don’t defend pride, no matter how dramatic the display. See pride for what it is, because the price of protecting it is too high. Respect what is authentic, and don’t pander to falseness. Speak up if the “Emperor has no clothes.” If there is an elephant in the room – that is what you need to speak about.

To align and cooperate with the right person will bring both joy and strength. A coming together, sharing, or building for a common purpose increases the chances of success.

Love is elevated when you unite your destinies.', 'Guidance: What two can do together is more than the sum of what either one can do alone.'),
    new card('200', 'DIVISION', 'You Have to Leave the Past Behind to Grow.', 'When something or someone is no longer serving you, a separation is the path forward. Going your separate ways does not have to be the end of connection or friendship. Sometimes we have to leave old ways and old patterns behind. Change is needed. A break-up, even a divorce, can lead to new freedom and growth. If you are not ready to leave physically, at least detach from unhealthy dynamics. Doing nothing, and going on as is, causes you to split yourself and your heart in two. Once you get clear and admit how you really feel, you can fly free.', 'Guidance: To become a butterfly, a caterpillar has to leave the cocoon.'),

We all want to feel the sense of respect that comes from a basic fairness. Without a sense of mutual equality, there is no good reason to stay together. A healthy relationship means both people recognize and acknowledge each other’s talents and abilities. It starts from a basic sense of equality, in order to sustain a balance of mutual appreciation. You each have unique gifts and strengths, but there must be a fundamental valuing of each other. If you don’t share a respect for each other, the relationship is not healthy.','Guidance: The experience of true equality nurtures stable love.'),
    new card('202', 'HOMOGENIZE', 'Celebrate the Differences that Unite Us.', 'No one can be just like you. We are all unique. Trying to blend yourself into another – to erase or deny differences - is to undermine the integrity of each of you. Having compassion for differences is what makes relationships endure. Instead of trying to get someone to be just like you – or trying to please them through conformity, work to appreciate and respect your differences. Do not attempt to create false unity where there is a genuine difference. The result is a dull blend that ignores the beauty of uniqueness.', 'Guidance: Celebrate uniqueness -- acceptance of difference elevates love.'),

When you live this way you feel your own respect, and others will come to respect you also. You become trustworthy because you are accountable and sincere. You can be both frank and kind.

Ask yourself: "If I was my teacher, what lesson would I have designed this experience for?" Once you recognize what lesson you need to learn, you can move forward, and stop repeating it! If you find yourself changing partners – but repeating the same story – it is time for a new story. One way to overcome repeated adversity is to learn the lesson faster, and then you can be free of the pattern.', 'Guidance: This too shall pass – but only if you change the pattern.'),
    new card('206', 'THE MAZE', 'If You Don’t Want to Hit the Same Walls, You Have to Choose a Different Path.', 'The road ahead may appear to be different – but if you haven’t changed – you may hit the same dead ends. If you are making choices from the same old patterns, you will end up with the same results. Ask yourself: “What did I do that led to this result? What did I really want? And what did I really get?” If you don’t like the results your actions brought, it is time to change your approach. There is a better way. It starts with being honest about what you really want and need.', 'Guidance: We repeat patterns until we are ready to change. When we change -- the results change.'),
    new card('207', 'DISCIPLINE', 'The Hard Choices Lead to the Best Decisions.', 'What appears to be the easy way out is often very expensive in the long term. If it looks too good to be true, it probably won’t be true for long. Be brave enough to do what you know to be right.  Making a hard choice which supports overall growth, health, freedom, and joy pays big. It is important to be able to motivate yourself to make good choices, not just settle for the status quo. There is great growth when you can delay gratification to more appropriate times and better situations.','Guidance: If you love yourself, you will harness your impulses.'),
    new card('208', 'PUNISHMENT', 'Punishing Doesn’t Change Behavior.', 'You can’t change another person by criticizing or punishing. And kicking yourself does not motivate you to be different. What you need is a new strategy of making better decisions in the future. Harness regret or frustration to make better choices from now on. A little discipline of your desires in the future is better than punishing yourself later. Besides, punishing doesn’t work because it doesn’t change behavior. Understanding motivations through compassion for choices made is the key to being able to change them.', 'Guidance: Ask yourself: “What do I need to forgive? And what do I need to be forgiven for?”'),
    new card('209', 'FREEDOM', 'No One Can Bind Us Without Our Consent.', 'You are in charge of your emotional freedom. It is a state of mind that no one can give you or take away. You are free – unless you submit to subjugation. That is the truth – because you can always choose freedom from reactivity. But it is up to you whether or not you choose the path of freedom. No one can keep you bound unless you agree to let them bind you. You always have the potential for freedom. We don’t always exercise our right to freedom. The fastest path to emotional freedom is to forgive yourself – or anyone else you blame for your lack of it.', 'Guidance: Emotional freedom is a state of mind. It is not something that somebody can give you or take away.'),
    new card('210', 'LICENSE', 'Don’t Wait for Someone Else to Grant You Permission for Something You Truly Desire.', 'No one can give you freedom or anything else you desire. You must make choices that move you in the direction you want to go. Do not waste time blaming another person, or waiting for them to give you permission to do or be something you wish to be. As you express your freedom do not use this as a license to hurt someone. But it does mean it is time to express yourself honestly and kindly. That is how you claim your power. It comes from within.', 'Guidance: Love is born from freedom, and thrives only where it is maintained.'),
    new card('211', 'COMMUNICATION', 'A Relationship is Only as Good as the Quality of the Communication.', 'Many problems, which appear to be about other issues, are really communication problems. What is it you are not saying? What is it your partner needs you to know but can’t say? Speak to these issues directly without allowing half-truths to cloud the airwaves. If you can find a way to communicate effectively, you are on your way to a solution. Communication exists on many levels -- emotional, mental, physical, sexual, and spiritual communication. Strive to use as many of these as possible to assist you in being direct and honest.', 'Guidance: The quality of a relationship is equal to the quality of the communication.'),
    new card('212', 'LIP SERVICE', 'The Words Sound Good, But the Actions Don’t Match.', 'Some people will say what they think you want to hear, or something to get a certain reaction. They believe they should say the words you want to hear, so they say all the right things. But the proof is in the feet. What do the feet do? Is the person walking towards you or away from you? If the actions match the words, you know you can trust the words. But if the actions do not match the spoken words – pay attention to the actions! Don’t be seduced by nice sounding words, let your partner know you value and want the truth.', 'Guidance: The truth is valuable and well-meaning. False words are worthless.'),

Do not ask someone else, or draw conclusions from scant evidence. Honor the element of truth in your feelings, but check it out for reality. The scale of misgivings may be off. Are the fears based in the past? Or are they accurate assessments of the present? This is an opportunity to express your vulnerability, and ask what you need to know directly. Do not blame or accuse the other person. Rather listen and observe, to sense what is really true.', 'Guidance: Fear and it will appear. Be careful of creating the very thing you are afraid of.'),

If you are not asking your partner for the direct truth, but instead are allowing your imagination to paint the worst possible picture, your mind will be filled with misgivings, doubt, and mistrust. Suspicion will eat away at your well-being. You need to replace this with accurate information.  Ask the question of the person you are suspicious of directly and without judgment. They will not tell you the truth if they do not believe it is safe to do so, so you must convey your genuine desire to hear what is really true. Invite them to experience the freedom that comes from honesty.', 'Guidance: Fear crowds out love, accurate information builds trust.'),
    new card('215', 'THE TEMPEST', 'When the Emotions are Running the Show, Nobody Shines.', 'When the emotions are raging, the relation-ship can be capsized. Emotions are important, but they should not override reason and wisdom. It is one thing to feel your feelings, it is another to impose them on others, or to let them cloud your thinking. Take a breath and calm down. Then look at the situation again once the storm has passed. Don’t make any decisions from an emotional tempest, as this frame of mind is not reliable.', 'Guidance: Emotional balance is the key to happiness. The mind and the heart must be united for peace of mind.'),
    new card('216', 'THE MACHINE', 'The Head Cannot Solve Matters of the Heart.', 'Logic is valuable for logical situations – but for matters of the heart, logic is woefully deficient. Using the mind exclusively will only lead to frustration and confusion. Leaving the heart out of the equation is like trying to understand French if you only speak English. Trying to think your way out of an emotional issue will not work. Logic alone leads to feeling cold. Be sure to communicate your feelings, even if it means admitting you just don’t understand the other person. Begin to listen to your heart and work toward a compassionate connection with your partner.', 'Guidance: The heart knows instantly what the mind can struggle for years to understand.'),
    new card('217', 'COMPLACENCY', 'What you Ignore -- Fades Away.', 'If you get lazy in a relationship, forget to nurture it, or do nice things for the other person, or check in with how the other person is really feeling – you may be unaware of what is really going on. Don’t assume that everything is fine with the other person – if you haven’t asked them what is going on and what they are really feeling. A false sense of security can lead to taking others for granted. Remaining unaware and unconcerned about unpleasant realities doesn’t make them go away. Nurture your relationship, or it will wilt and eventually fade away.', 'Guidance: Pay attention to who and what is really important.'),
    new card('218', 'WAKE-UP CALL', 'If You Only Focus On Your Needs, You Will Be Left to Face Them Alone.', 'If you are not attending to your partner’s feelings and needs, you may be not seeing the discontent going on right under your nose. Attune to your partner’s subtle cues, and ask directly how they are feeling. You don’t want to remain unaware of your partner’s unmet needs and desires. If you are too focused on your own experience, and start to take your partner for granted, they will begin to doubt you really love them.', 'Guidance: To grow, a relationship needs appreciation each day.'),
    new card('219', 'THE BUFFET', 'You Are Not Ready to Choose to Commit.', 'Allow yourself to look around a little more. You need small tastes and samples from the buffet of life. This is not the time to commit, because you are not finished investigating. Don’t hurt anybody by promising to be more ready than you are. Allow yourself to just look at other options a little more. Be honest about being at this stage – with yourself and anyone else who might be affected by your need to look around some more.', 'Guidance: You can’t choose wisely until you are satisfied you have checked out enough choices.'),

It is another to become attached to erratic hopping from branch to branch, person to person, activity to activity. If you are scrambling to make sure you collect every nut that you desire – and you don’t stay in any one place long enough to enjoy them, and you will lose them all. Stop trying to collect all the different nuts and learn to enjoy the one you have. You will feel more fulfilled when you learn to give yourself to another, instead of collecting trophy encounters.', 'Guidance: Always hopping around will make you feel empty inside.'),
    new card('221', 'REFLECTION', 'In Order to Better Understand What is Going on Around You – Look Within.', 'What is happening in your world is a reflection of what is happening inside you. Turn your gaze inward to understand. What is it about your own thoughts, beliefs, or patterns that are being reflected and demonstrated for you? Make self-corrections instead of trying to find fault with others. Instead of trying to get someone else to change to make you feel better, look at how you are creating the dynamic between you. In this way, you can begin to take the reins of your life into your own hands.', 'Guidance: When you accept that you are creating your reality, then you can also re-create it.'),
    new card('222', 'TWO-TO-TANGO', 'Either One of You Can Change the Dance Routine.', 'Just as it takes two people to create any relationship dynamic – if any one person stops playing the game – everything changes.  The patterns will shift if even one person makes healthier choices, or starts speaking the truth, or asking for what they need. If anyone changes the old dance routine, it is a new dance. It is wise and more productive to change your own dance step than to complain about someone else’s.', 'Guidance: If you don’t like the dance you are doing, change the routine before you try to change partners.'),
    new card('223', 'FORGIVENESS', 'There is No Winning in the Blame Game.', 'Blaming yourself traps you for eternity. Blaming another person leads to resentment, and diminishes love. Decide to stop playing the blame game. Whether it is about forgiving yourself or another, it is the only path to freedom. Blaming keeps you trapped in the victim mode. Let go, and you can both be free and move on. It is not about whether or not a certain action or choice is “forgivable” – it is about being willing to let go of past wounds. Otherwise, the cycle of blame just repeats endlessly. There is no light at the end of the blame-tunnel.', 'Guidance: When even one person forgives, two are set free.'),
    new card('224', 'OSTRICH', 'Ignoring a Problem Does Not Make It Go Away.', 'Ignoring a problem is like not taking out the trash – it doesn’t go away. It starts to stink and soon collects vermin. Begin to face the problem directly by being honest about how it affects you. Without blame, seek to communicate your need for change. Sweeping a problem under the rug just means that when a strong and unexpected wind blows, you will be blinded. You know there is something you need to face. The sooner you do so, the quicker you can improve the quality of your life and your partnership.', 'Guidance: It is more loving to face the truth than to hide it.'),
    new card('225', 'OPENNESS', 'Remove Your Blinders and You Will See the Beauty that is There For You.', 'You will only receive that which you are seeking if you are ready and willing to be open. It starts with being able to open your mind to new ideas, new possibilities, and new partnerships. Be aware of what is already pointed in your direction. Express interest and desire to someone who has been putting out “feelers.” First, you must create an open and receptive space if you wish to create something new. The Universe will not force love on you. It is waiting for you to open your heart and mind.', 'Guidance: You will be given what you are open to receive.'),
    new card('226', 'CHOOSE WISELY', 'Choose from the Present – Not the Past.', 'In order to choose wisely, you must make sure you are oriented toward present reality, rather than past conditioning. It is difficult to discern what is really true if your perceptions are colored by past experiences. Ask yourself if your current preconceptions accurately reflect reality, or if they are based on fear from the past. Get clear about what you really want, and make selections that are not marred by your past disappointments. That way you can make better choices.','Guidance: Choose wisely to regain your power.'),
    new card('227', 'BUILDING', 'Build on a Solid Foundation of Mutual Appreciation.', 'It doesn’t make sense to build on a foundation that isn’t solid. Make sure you are on the same page as your partner. Otherwise you are putting in more effort than is reciprocated. This imbalance can create a shaky foundation. This may make you feel like you are taking one step forward, two steps back. Be bold and talk directly about this with your partner, because the truth is the only reliable indicator that your heart is in safe hands. Otherwise, your efforts and energy may not be worth it. Without mutual appreciation, the relationship becomes lopsided.', 'Guidance: Appreciation builds, taking for granted destroys.'),
    new card('228', 'SAND CASTLES', 'Not All Fun Withstands the Test of Time.', 'At the beginning, a relationship may look great. From the outside everything might seem perfect. Just be sure to take a second look! Love at first sight, or first kiss, is exciting. But if it is not built on a solid foundation, and when the tide turns, you may watch your dreams slide away. Be honest about what you really want. Don’t settle for something that “looks good on the outside” but won’t hold up to the first big wave.', 'Guidance: Build your dream castles on more solid ground.'),
    new card('229', 'OVERFLOW', 'Love Comes from Fullness, Not Emptiness.', 'If your heart is already filled -- with emptiness -- there is no room for someone else. You have to empty and release the pain and sadness to make room for someone new. Healthy people are not attracted to sorrow. Begin to re-fill your heart with the flow of love – love of life, love of self, and love of your passions. This is what will attract another to the glow of your life force. Then you can give to another from your fullness, not neediness. Love is a flow -- a continuous series of actions you take. It is not a “thing” to be held or lost.', 'Guidance: Love is something you do, not something you get.'),
    new card('230', 'EMPTY', 'Let Go of the Past to Make a Beautiful Space for the Present.', 'If your cup is full of accumulated stuff, you have no room left in your heart to receive. Your past history has too much influence over you, making it hard to enjoy anything new. Let go of a former lover whose memory is keeping you from letting in someone new. To be healed you must resolve and let go of wounds. New love is waiting to come to you, but you must open your space. Clear out the old in order to receive.', 'Guidance: Make room in your heart to receive new energy, inspiration, and love.'),
    new card('231', 'GRATITUDE', 'Gratitude is the Attitude that Heals.', 'Everyone wants to feel appreciated. Showing the person you love gratitude is one of the best things you can do to nurture the relationship. We all want acceptance for who we are, and acknowledgment of our strengths. Being thankful for being able to experience love is a great way to increase the flow of love into your life. Gratitude creates a beneficial state of mind for receiving more love. Gratitude is the antithesis of depression. When you are feeling low, think of three things you can feel grateful for.', 'Guidance: For what in Life do you feel most thankful?'),
    new card('232', 'LONGING', 'Instead of Focusing on What You Don’t Have, Put Your Attention on Opening Your Heart to Receive.', 'Endless longing for someone or something you don’t have creates a mental groove of stuckness. You repeat the same pattern over and over. Craving that which is unattainable is a habit that no longer serves you. Protracted waiting for someone who isn’t coming is a strategy for misery. Ask yourself, “Would I rather continue to suffer? Or release the longing, so that I can receive what is ready to come my way?”', 'Guidance: Make a space in your heart for the love that is trying to find you.'),
    new card('233', 'EMOTIONAL EXPRESSION', 'Say What is Truly in Your Heart, and You Set Yourself Free.', 'If you are feeling something important, say it! There is no guarantee that the other person will respond as you wish, but holding back your feelings creates an energetic backlog. Love is about the two-way flow of energy. To jump start your heart, say what you are feeling as soon as possible. Hiding too much from yourself or others builds up toxicity and resentment. Let your emotions out in smaller, manageable amounts, and they won’t be so overwhelming.', 'Guidance: Listen to your heart and speak your truth with love.'),
    new card('234', 'EMOTIONAL EXPLOSION', 'If Emotions Build Up for Too Long Without Healthy Expression, They Will Implode or Explode.', 'If you don’t stay current with your emotional expression, you build a backlog of unexpressed feelings. Then resentment builds up. This erodes the feeling of love, and creates a pressure on both people that is hard to cut through. If you are carrying too much baggage from unexpressed hurts and disappointments, the relationship becomes burdened and heavy. The largeness of the emotions is because they tap into old traumas. Separate the past from the present, deal with each one in appropriate ways. Don’t impose your past on your present.', 'Guidance: Emotions are energy that needs to flow. Don’t conceal the truth of your feelings or you will burst.'),
    new card('235', 'RECKLESS', 'Taking Bold Action Without Regard to Consequences is Like Buying on Credit – It Costs Much More Over Time.', 'It feels very exciting to leap and plunge into novelty. But if this wild daring has negative consequences, then the price is very high for a temporary thrill. Slow down and evaluate the choices presenting themselves. What is in front of you is very compelling. But living entirely for the moment – ignoring that there is a tomorrow is like going over Niagara Falls in a barrel. It’s a rush – but is it worth dying for?', 'Guidance: All actions have consequences -- some come sooner, some later, but they all come.'),
    new card('236', 'DESPERATION', 'Don’t Make Major Decisions from Fear.', 'The feeling of urgency that comes from fear will cloud your thinking. FEAR is False Evidence Appearing Real. Believing the messages that fear generates leads to desperate actions and despair. Making decisions that are driven by fear can be dangerous. It can take a long time to reverse the damage. What seems like a last resort is not a reason to choose it. Desperation drives people away from you, because no one wants to be around desperation. Let go of the fear, and love will find you.','Guidance: Fear closes out love and pushes it away.'),
    new card('237', 'AWARENESS', 'Self-Awareness is the Basis of Personal Power.', 'To be aware and awake to the truth of who you are is the greatest protection. It keeps you centered and helps you make the best decisions. Knowledge of the world around you is important, but what is most import is understanding what is really going on inside you. If you really know what you are feeling, you have a better sense of what you want. You are less likely to allow someone to talk you out of your truth. Self-awareness keeps you alert to what feelings are being triggered, and what games are being played.', 'Guidance: Awareness itself is the beginning of the healing process.'),
    new card('238', 'ON GUARD', 'If You Are Hunting for a Problem, You Will Find One.', 'If you are convinced there is a problem, the evidence to support your attitude will present itself. It can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, and you may create it as much as discover it. This doesn’t mean to be blind to problems, but it does mean you need to shift your focus to finding solutions. Do not allow past hurts to color your view of the present. Allow this time to be different. Don’t impose your map of previous failed relationships to guide you in this one.','Guidance: Fear -- and it will appear. What you put energy into is what you get more of.'),
    new card('239', 'RESPECT', 'Mutual Respect is the Recipe for Healthy Relationships.', 'We all have our strengths and we all have our weaknesses. You don’t want to be overly focused on weakness. Notice the weakness, but put two-thirds of your energy into validating and acknowledging the strengths. Honor yourself and your partner with acceptance and recognition of the inner core worth of each of you. Appreciating strengths are what gives us the energy to be willing to change, or grow parts of ourselves that need healing.', 'Guidance: Build relationships based on mutual respect -- and you will have a solid foundation for all else that comes.'),
    new card('240', 'REVERENCE', 'If You Put Someone on a Pedestal – You Can’t Reach Them and They Can’t Touch You.', 'It is one thing to admire someone. It is another to venerate or idealize them so far as to be in awe. The problem is that if you put someone on a pedestal, they can’t reach you and you can’t reach them. Eventually they will fail in some way, and crash down on you. Don’t set them up for a fall by assuming they are perfect in every way. What you admire in them – may be latent qualities in yourself that you have yet to nurture or develop. Put your focus on finding within yourself that which you admire in another.', 'Guidance: Love needs equality to grow, not hierarchy.'),
    new card('241', 'CENTERED', 'Your Inner Truth Will Guide You.', 'Instead of looking to others for answers, stay connected to what you know to be true. People may try to influence you and get you engaged in their dramas. Focus on your center, and you will be able to maintain the inward calm needed to navigate the twists and turns of life. By staying in this balanced perspective, you will be able to remain connected to your personal power. By focusing on what feels true, you will restore a strong sense of self.', 'Guidance: Find your center -- and you will find your truth.'),
    new card('242', 'ALOOF', 'Remaining Disengaged is a Dangerous Game.', 'It may look like being emotionally distant or reserved is a safe position. But this reticence and apparent disinterest take more energy than you realize. It diminishes your enthusiasm for life. It takes a lot of energy to resist -- which means that you are more involved than you think. Find the willingness to fully play. If you are only half in the game, with the other part of you distant, this splits you in two. Frozen emotions make life dull and dreary. Be willing to risk the thaw!', 'Guidance: Ask yourself: "What am I afraid of losing?"'),
    new card('243', 'WARMING UP', 'Everyone’s Timing is Different.', 'Everyone moves at their own pace in love. It is wonderful when two people both increase their energy or intensity of feelings. Just don’t always expect this to happen at the exact same moment. It is better if each person is allowed to increase their focus and commitment on their own schedule. Each person warms up in their own style and at their own pace. A slow heating up is likely to last longer than a fast boil. Trust and go with the flow.', 'Guidance: There is a perfect timing which can’t be forced.'),
    new card('244', 'COOLING DOWN', 'Resisting Change Does Not Stop It.', 'Sometimes emotions are high, sometimes low. But you want to be calm enough to sense the overall pattern. Is there a decrease in emotional intensity, energy, commitment, and focus? This is a sign that a partnership may be slowing down. Step back and observe the change. In Nature there are cycles of intensity or growth. This is also true for emotions and desire. Find the ease with this cycle and embrace the changes that are coming.', 'Guidance: Relax -- change is natural.'),
    new card('245', 'AURORA', 'There is Total Darkness – Just Before the Dawn.', 'The darkness before the dawn is named after the Roman Goddess, Aurora. In the middle of the darkness it can be hard to imagine the dawn. Do not despair! Look for the great tiny flashes of light that foretell the coming dawn. See the light in small things. Otherwise, you might underestimate its presence. Light and dark exist together, but it may not be obvious to the eye which only sees one or the other. Just because you cannot see the moon at every moment doesn’t mean it has gone away.', 'Guidance: Light is everywhere -- even in apparent darkness.'),
    new card('246', 'SISYPHUS', 'Repeating the Same Old Patterns Leads to the Same Results.', 'You can change partners, but if you haven’t changed the patterns within yourself, nothing changes. New faces, names, and circumstances may look different, but if the dynamics remain the same you will find yourself reading the same script, saying the same disappointed lines. The struggle is less with the other person and more with your own history, the baggage you haul along. The only way to win is to change who you are and how you play the game.', 'Guidance: Change your expectations, and your reality will change.'),
    new card('247', 'NEW MOON', 'Be Bold and Start Something New.', 'In the new phases of a relationship or project, risks must be taken to let go of the confines of fears. Let go of the old fear-based ways of doing things. Allow yourself to be born again. You have to be brave to start something new. This is the time to be bold.

Don’t settle for anyone else’s answers to these questions if they are not true for you.  Sometimes it is hard, but without learning, there is only decay.

Nothing feels real when you are conforming to someone else’s version of yourself. Just because you were once cast in a role doesn’t mean you have to continue playing that part. You are bored by the predictability of waiting for other people’s cues. Take charge of your life by rewriting your narrative. Tear up the old script and be the director of your own life. Tell the story you want to tell through the actions you want to take.', 'Guidance: Be the hero in your own life story.'),
    new card('251', 'CONSTANCY', 'Healthy Stability Allows for Growth.', 'Healthy stability allows for sustained growth. Unhealthy stagnation attempts to prevent change. Finding a balanced consistency can give you the foundation to move forward. That means not getting too attached to things being the same.

Indecision creates restlessness. Your mind keeps changing because the emotions are broiling below, causing your moods to swing. There may be opposing needs which create havoc and make it difficult for you to move forward. It is easier to feel that the grass is greener on the other side, but it rarely is.

It is best to take changes into your own hands rather than waiting to be struck by lightning. Resisting change is natural but can become dangerous if continued for too long. If you don’t take needed action, you will find that it is taken, and then you will have to deal with the consequences.

Even if someone has harmed you, only you can choose to repair your heart. Reconcile when you can. If this is not possible, move on. Cleanse your energy of old ties.

The journey of discovery is unique to you, and no one can know what is right or wrong for you. Only take actions that reflect your truth. Doing what you are meant to do will bring you peace, but you may have to “fight” the resistance from within and without.

Other times we need a soft, diffused focus that can take in the whole field. Both points of view are valuable, and you want to be able to switch back and forth to see the whole truth. Being blinded by attachment or fixation to a goal is very limiting. Stop and "see the roses" -- of the side you might be missing.

Perpetual in-between-ness is deadening and can destroy relationships. If you are sitting on the fence, try a small step in one direction. If it feels wrong, take the opposite step. You can’t just think your way out of this. You have to sense how the action feels in your body and in your heart. Indecision can become a bad habit. This can lead to depression, despair, and hopelessness. Any action is better than allowing this to go on for too long.', 'Guidance: Take an action step. Make a positive change.'),

Powerful attraction is delightful, but can cloud the mind. The power of this pull may be a karmic connection – the lure of the past exerting itself on the present. Not all important connections become lasting partnerships. If it feels like a soul connection, there are lessons to be learned and gifts to be shared. Just make sure your eyes are open. Be careful not to burn in the flames of desire.', 'Guidance: No matter how strong the pull, there is always a choice.'),

It is important to recognize that you have this source of femininity from within. You are a very creative person, and you need to learn to work with this power. You are capable of fertility, abundance, and manifestation -- of all that you desire – partnership, marriage, and children. But you must balance this power within.

That only stops you from being prepared to handle it in the best way possible. Instead, wake up and face the music. Take one small action in the direction of dealing with the issue directly. You will find that avoiding it has taken much more energy than it will take to finally engage with it. Say the words that must be said. Take the action that needs to be taken.

Trying to be the authority for another, or trying to restrict them from pursuing their path, is a ticket to disaster.

You have to care about your own well-being more than you care about someone else’s approval - otherwise, you risk acting like a doormat. Once you get walked on, you both lose.

Just waiting for things to happen causes a haphazard, lazy approach.  Instead of always just taking things as they come, begin to direct your life. If you want more love in your life, you need to take action to find it. It is nice to be easy-going, but you can feel unmoored, unguided, and have no vision of the future.  You have to go out and seek who and what you want. Being passive with your destiny is leaving everything to chance.', 'Guidance: It is time to take charge of your own ship and chart your course.'),

It is time to be free and love again.'),

For example, if in the first relationship you get "dumped," and then in the next relationship you "dump." This “tit for tat” behavior keeps you stuck in the wheel of karma.

Keep moving toward that view. Relationships are not supposed to cause endless suffering.  Cherish who you really are, and find someone who is in alignment with this mission.

If you have not been speaking up about your simple inner truth, you will pollute your relationship with withheld feelings – and this leads to resenting the other person.

Instead set your vision forward. See yourself as the unrestricted person you wish to be. What is it you would like to do with your personal freedom? Take a step in that direction.

Instead of viewing yourself as a victim of this lesson, search for the value it holds for you. Ask yourself “What is the lesson in this experience?

This doesn’t mean that what you want will come immediately, or that it will come from the source from which you are hoping to receive it. Your job is to own your truth and speak up, instead of hiding your truth. First, you must understand your true dreams and intentions, then ask yourself if your actions are moving you toward or away from your heart’s desire. Adjust your action to be a match to your intention. Then trust that what you truly need will be manifested from the right source.', 'Guidance: As I am true to my heart, I will be open to receive.'),

    new card('316', 'TURTLE WISDOM', 'Slow and Steady Wins the Heart.', 'Find your own timing. Do not let another’s sense of time override your own. It is fine if someone is in another rhythm, because everyone has their own perfect pace. But do not allow another’s sense of time to cause you to move in a way that is not right for you. Listen to your timing. It comes from deep within. That is why the turtle has its head to the ground, to hear what others are ignoring.', 'Guidance: Trust your internal sense of timing, it will not lead you astray.'),

This is to wake us up from denial. It doesn’t serve us to avoid the truth. We need to wake and face the music.
